For this event, we have invited speakers from different companies and tech communities to talk about their personal journey into data science and beyond and share some lessons they've learned along the way.</p> <p>6:00 Doors open<br/>6:30 Welcome from WiMLDS, PyLadies SF, DoorDash<br/>6:40 Talks by Melanie Warrick, Kasia Rachuta, Raquel Araujo<br/>8:00 Panel discussion with the speakers and invited guests, socializing<br/>9:00 Doors close</p> <p>Speakers and invited panelists:</p> <p>Melanie Warrick is a Developer Relations Engineer for AI and the Cloud at Google and speaks a lot about AI and ML. She was a founding engineer on a deep learning platform prior to Google and worked on machine learning engineering at Change.org. In another life she had a comprehensive consulting career, as an IC and leading teams both domestic and international and before that she was working behind the scenes in the film industry. In her spare time, she sleeps.</p> <p>Kasia Rachuta works as a Data Scientist at Medium. She has a Master’s in theoretical physics from University College London. In her spare time, she enjoys volunteering for women-related organizations and diversity causes, scuba diving and traveling.</p> <p>Raquel Araujo works at Indeed as a Product Scientist in the Applicant Quality team after working as a Business Intelligence Analyst. After trying to be an Economics PhD student, she found a job in analytics and never looked back.</p> <p>Jessica Lachs is the Head of Analytics at DoorDashJessica and the team are responsible for all things data including product analytics, business analytics, business intelligence, and data science. Prior to DoorDash, Jessica was the founder and CEO of GiftSimple, a social gifting startup. She began her career in investment banking, spending over 3 years at Lehman Brother in NYC. Jessica holds a BS from Cornell, and an MBA from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Grishma Jena is a Cognitive Software Engineer with Data Science for Marketing at IBM Watson. She did her Masters at University of Pennsylvania and moved to San Francisco a year ago. She volunteers at the San Francisco Public Library and has mentored high school students on Artificial Intelligence as part of the non-profit AI4ALL.</p> <p>Paula Alves is a Data Scientist at DigiSight. She became a data scientist after a succeful career in Geophysics, Geology and Manufacturing.</p> <p>Talk 1: Tech career path advice (Melanie Warrick)<br/>I've worked in many companies and industries and my path into technology has not been a straight line. I am sharing what I've experienced developing my career and advice that has helped me get where I am now. The goal is to get you thinking about your career paths in ways you haven't considered.</p> <p>Talk 2: From physics to data science - a numbers journey (Kasia Rachuta)<br/>Prior to starting my career in tech, I worked for the UK equivalent of the National Science Foundation; completed a couple of internships in social impact measurement and volunteered in Spain, Kenya and London. After I finished my master's, I decided to try something new and that's how I found myself in data science. I will cover being self-taught, what resources have helped me get where I am, as well as touch on the importance of mentorship and advocating for yourself.</p> <p>Talk 3: What I learned from every job I held and how that shaped who I am today (Raquel Araujo)<br/>My journey into data science was not a typical one. But whose is it, anyway? When I was looking for a job in a tech company, I had to market myself as ready for the industry after spending several years in academia. At the same time, I had to learn to navigate the previously unknown (to me) whiteboard interviews, homework assignments, coding challenges, etc. I want to share what I learned from every step in my career with other people who may find themselves in a similar situation.</p> ",

You will then be sent an eNDA which needs to be signed 24 hours before the event, for security reasons. A badge would be pre-printed for you when you arrive at the event. Please register here.</p> <p>Talk #1: Foundations of streaming SQL or: How I learned to love stream and table theory</p> <p>This talk will address all of those questions in two parts.<br/>First, we’ll explore the relationship between the Beam Model (as described in The Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 blog posts) and stream &amp; table theory (as popularized by Martin Kleppmann and Jay Kreps, etc., but essentially originating out of the database world).</p> <p>Second, we’ll apply our clear understanding of that relationship towards explaining what is required to provide robust stream processing support in SQL. We’ll discuss concrete efforts that have been made in this area by the Apache Beam, Calcite, and Flink communities, compare to other offerings such as Kafka KSQL &amp; Spark Structured streaming, and talk about new ideas yet to come.</p> <p>In the end, you can expect to have a much better understanding of the key concepts underpinning data processing, regardless of whether that data processing batch or streaming, SQL or programmatic, as well as a concrete notion of what robust stream processing in SQL looks like.</p> <p>Speaker: Tyler Akidau(Google)<br/>Tyler Akidau is a staff software engineer at Google Seattle. He leads technical infrastructure’s internal data processing teams (MillWheel &amp; Flume), is a founding member of the Apache Beam PMC, and has spent the last seven years working on massive-scale data processing systems. He is the author of the 2015 Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 articles on the O’Reilly website. His preferred mode of transportation is by cargo bike, with his two young daughters in tow.</p> <p>Talk #2: Kinesis at Lyft</p> <p>This talk will focus on how we used Amazon Kinesis to build the pub-sub infra at Lyft, that ingests more than a 100 billion events per day. We'll review the strengths and weaknesses of Kinesis as a choice for streaming events in realtime, at Lyft's scale; as well as the best practices and lessons learnt over time.</p> <p>Speaker: Hafiz Hamid (Lyft)</p> <p>Hafiz Hamid is a software engineer on the Pub-Sub/Streaming Platform team at Lyft. He has built some of the key pieces in the messaging &amp; streaming infrastructure at Lyft. Previously, Hafiz was a technical lead at Bing Search where he worked on data pipelines, relevance and web crawlers.</p> <p>Talk #3: Data all over the place! How Apache Calcite brings SQL and sanity to streaming and spatial data</p> <p>The revolution has happened. We are living the age of the deconstructed database. The modern enterprises are powered by data, and that data lives in many formats and locations, in-flight and at rest, but somewhat surprisingly, the lingua franca for remains SQL. In this talk, Julian describes Apache Calcite, a toolkit for relational algebra that powers many systems including Apache Beam, Flink and Hive. He discusses some areas of development in Calcite: streaming SQL, materialized views, enabling spatial query on vanilla databases, and what a mash-up of all three might look like.</p> <p>Speaker: Julian Hyde (Looker)</p> <p>Julian Hyde is an expert in query optimization and in-memory analytics. He founded Apache Calcite, a framework for query optimization and data virtualization. He also founded Mondrian, the popular open source OLAP engine, and co-founded SQLstream, an early streaming SQL platform. He is an architect at Looker.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:00 - 6:30 pm: Check in and settle, networking<br/>6:30 - 6:35 pm: Intros<br/>6:35 - 7:10 pm - Talk #1 Tyler Akidau (Google)<br/>7:15 - 7:50 pm - Talk #2 Hafiz Hamid (Lyft)<br/>7:55 - 8:30 pm - Talk #3 Julian Hyde (Looker)<br/>8:30 - 8:45 pm - Wrap up</p> ",

High-end apparel, accessories, and luxury goods toe a careful line: On one hand, underground resale markets for their products make them clear targets for online fraud. On the other hand, turning away customers willing to pay for high-end products means huge sums of money left on the table - especially when those customers belong to emerging segments, for instance from the rising middle class in developing markets.</p> <p>Historically, high-end fashion retailers have leaned away from risk, declining a large number of customers suspected of being fraudulent. But unprecedented breadth and depth of data on risk and fraud behavior is making it possible to accept payments without fear, changing the way siloed merchants have run their businesses.</p> <p>7:30 Cognitive Search: Understanding user intentions to build interactive search and discovery experiences<br/>Ciro Greco, Founder and CEO at TOOSO <a href=\"https://Tooso.ai/\" class=\"linkified\">https://Tooso.ai/</a></p> <p>8:00-8:15 Closing remarks</p> ",

From smart thermostats and security cams to power grid forecasting and wireless communication chips, Sourav co-founded Manifold in 2016 and today works with leading companies to build custom AI solutions that increase productivity and efficiency. He also serves as an advisor to Glifft (gift giving platform that uses AI and ML technology), Cortex Building Intelligence (real-estate software), and GroGuru, Inc. (agriculture technology). He holds patents for his work, has been published in several IEEE journals and has won numerous awards for his work in AI.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>AI and machine learning have the power to transform entire industries. Companies in consumer-facing industries like banking, healthcare, and e-commerce that aren’t using these new tools and advances today run the real risk of failure as we gear towards an automated future.</p> <p>A talk about the importance for today’s companies to adopt ML and data science and how they can do it. Using specific real-world use cases, Sourav will detail his process for casting business problems as machine learning problems—from identifying which business problem to solve to hypothesis generation, to AB testing. He’ll explain how to transform, segment, and measure variables to obtain meaningful data unique to each company, and share examples of how businesses he’s worked with have implemented these technologies to analyze specific areas of their business and resolve their toughest problems.</p> <p>ODSC Links:<br/>• Get free access to more talks like this at LearnAI:<br/><a href=\"https://learnai.odsc.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://learnai.odsc.com/</a><br/>• Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/</a><br/>• Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odsc\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/odsc</a> &amp; @odsc<br/>• LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/</a><br/>• WEST Conference Oct 31 - Nov 3: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/california\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/california</a></p> ",

Given the sheer volume of online and offline events that need to be tracked while planning and executing ad campaigns; the unprecedented amount of decisions that need to be made in real-time; and the Internet-scale analytics that needs to be performed before, during, and after each campaign; this industry could not have arrived at its current level of maturity without all the recent advances in big data technologies.</p> <p>With data playing the central role in today’s digital advertising, a very important class of services has emerged in the advertising landscape: Data Management Platforms, or DMPs. The purpose of a DMP is to seamlessly (and rapidly) collect, integrate, analyze, and activate large volumes of data to ultimately make advertising as effective as possible.</p> <p>This tutorial will cover in detail the challenges involved in building a modern data management platform for digital advertising, and some of the high-impact research opportunities that exist in this Space.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>In this talk John Mount of Win-Vector, LLC will demonstrate the CRAN package rquery, and the new package rqdatatable.</p> <p>rquery is a query generator for R based on Edgar F. Codd's relational algebra, and on production experience using SQL and dplyr at big data scale. rquery is powerful, easy to teach, has error checking, and basic query optimization. It is the fastest way to manipulate remote big data from R, for example data found on PostgreSQL or Spark. rqdatatable is a new package that implements the rquery grammar in memory using the data.table package. This allows the same rquery pipeline to be used remotely. such as on Spark, and for in-memory data. rqdatatable transforms are usually nearly as fast as native data.table code and usually much faster than the equivalent base-R or dplyr code.</p> <p>These packages can save substantial development and infrastructure costs.</p> <p>BIO</p> <p>John Mount is a principal consultant at Win-Vector LLC. He is a frequent writer, speaker, and R package contributor. He is one of the authors of the popular book \"Practical Data Science with R\" (Zumel, Mount; Manning 2014).

        "description": "<p>ABSTRACT:<br/>The transactional DB tier powering geo-distributed cloud apps such as those found in Retail, Finance and SaaS verticals has been a high-latency, hard-to-scale, master-slave RDBMS for a long time. Multi-master configuration or use of a separate NoSQL DB (for multi-region data distribution) are common solutions. However, none of these solutions achieve the desired business outcomes of high customer satisfaction, increased data protection, and regulatory compliance.</p> <p>YugaByte DB, a new open source transactional DB, delivers the above business outcomes with ease. It does so by bringing together the best of SQL and NoSQL worlds into a unified DB. On one hand, it accelerates application development through multiple APIs (YSQL, Redis &amp; PostgreSQL) that have built-in RDBMS-like data safety as well as have flexible data management features such as JSON data type, secondary indexes, Time-To-Live and tunable read latency. On the other hand, it also enables cloud-native operational agility through automated provisioning of multi-region/multi-cloud clusters combined with extreme fault-tolerance for ensuring zero downtime and zero data loss in dynamic cloud environments.</p> <p>This session will highlight how geo-distributed cloud apps can get started with YugaByte DB's recent 1.0 release and thereafter future-proof their DB needs for years to come. A real-world E-Commerce app built on the YERN (YugaByte DB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack will be used as an example.</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Karthik Ranganathan (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kranganathan/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kranganathan/</a>), Co-Founder &amp; CTO of YugaByte, is a highly experienced database and distributed systems engineer who built much of Facebook's Apache HBase-based NoSQL platform. He drove the platform's adoption across several mission-critical use cases at Facebook and has even helped a number of companies adopt HBase as a part of the open source community. Prior to HBase, he worked on Cassandra before it was called Cassandra or was open-sourced. Karthik received his BS and MS in CS from IIT-M and UT Austin.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Overview:<br/>Join us for insightful conversations on the first of a series of meetups called \"Building Qubole\". This event will focus on the SQL Big Data Engine, Presto, and featuring some seriously delicious beers. The talks will be given by two Lead Data Engineers from Qubole on various open-source features and tools they’ve optimized Presto for servicing hundreds of users each day.</p> <p>We'll explore the state of Presto today and optimizations that Qubole is driving to make it a first class tool. Focusing on the challenges looking into the future of Presto in 2018, as well as OSS examples and best practices that help optimize Presto for different big data workloads.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6-6:30 pm - Networking (drinks + snacks)<br/>6:30-7:00 pm - Session 1<br/>7:00-7:30 pm Session 2<br/>7:30-8:00 pm - Q&amp;A<br/>8:00-8:30 pm - Networking</p> <p>Session 1<br/>Title: SQL Join Optimizations in Qubole Presto<br/>Speaker: Amogh Margoor, Staff Engineer</p> <p>Abstract: SQL Joins are a common and critical component of interactive SQL workloads. The Qubole Presto team has worked on two important JOIN optimizations to dramatically improve the performance of queries on Qubole Presto. We will talk about 2 join optimizations introduced in Qubole Presto:<br/>• Join Reordering<br/>• Dynamic Filtering</p> <p>We also present improvement in runtime of TPC-DS queries due to these join optimizations. Specifically we show that:<br/>• Join Reordering provides a maximum improvement of 6X.<br/>• Dynamic Filtering provides 2.8X geomean improvement and 14X maximum improvement.<br/>• Due to better resource utilization from these optimizations, Qubole Presto can now run 90 TPC-DS queries compared to 72 without these optimizations.</p> <p>About -<br/>Amogh Margoor is yet another Software Developer (YASD) currently working at Qubole. His area of interests are Compilers, Big Data Engines and SQL Optimizers. At Qubole he has worked on the internals of Hive and Presto. Specifically, he has worked on join optimizations like Dynamic Filtering and Join Reordering, Join Distribution types, Materialized Views, OLAP Cubes, Auto-Tuning Big Data Stack, infrastructure for AIR (data intelligence and QDS internal Data warehouse), Big Data Engine Optimizations for cloud etc.</p> <p>Session 2<br/>Speaker/Role: Abhishek Das, Software Engineering Team Lead</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Abhishek will discuss some deeper insights into the use cases for Apache Presto. Abhishek will share Qubole open-source and internal optimizations made to improve Presto for different SQL workloads to 2.5x performance improvement (ETL, ad-hoc, and reporting).</p> <p>Specifically, he will dive into performance improvement in Presto due to caching solution such as Rubix (an open-source solution for caching in Spark and Presto). As well as share empirical data on the efficacy of these optimizations and lessons learned from running columnar caches at scale that led to the design of Rubix.</p> <p>About -<br/>Abhishek Das is a Software Engineering Team Lead for Rubix at Qubole. He has developed large-scale implementations for Hadoop 2, Hive and Tez. Currently, Abhishek focuses on developing solutions to improve the performance of Apache Presto and Spark. Abhishek has worked on many massive-scale projects, helping companies implement ETL and analytics big data clusters for the past 4-years at Qubole.</p> ",

A key question in climate science is How much global warming should we expect for a given increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide? One strategy for addressing this question is to run physical models of the global climate system but these models vary in their estimates of future warming by about a factor of two. Our research has attempted to narrow this range of uncertainty around model-projected future warming and to assess whether the upper or lower end of the model range is more likely. We showed that there are strong statistical relationships between how models simulate fundamental features of the Earth's energy budget over the recent past, and how much warming models simulate in the future. Importantly, we find that models that match observations the best over the recent past, tend to simulate more warming in the future than the average model. Thus, statistically combining information from physical models and observations tells us that we should expect more warming (with smaller uncertainty ranges) than we would expect if we were just looking at physical models in isolation and ignoring observations.</p> <p>Speaker Bio</p> <p>Patrick is a postdoctoral research scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Wisconsin - Madison and a Ph.D. in Earth and Ocean Sciences from Duke University.He has interests in climate modeling, Earth's energy budget, emergent properties of complex systems, chaos, statistics, climate-society interaction and quantifying difficult-to-quantify things.</p> ",

(Capacity for 200)</p> <p>Viewing Party -<br/>Lotta’s Fountain Conference Room, LinkedIn in San Francisco at 222 2nd Street, San Francisco, CA. (Capacity for 70)</p> <p>AGENDA:<br/>6PM: Doors open<br/>6-6:35 PM: Networking &amp; Welcome</p> <p>6:35-7:10 PM: Beam me up Samza: How we built a Samza Runner for Apache Beam (Xinyu Liu, LinkedIn)<br/>Apache Beam provides an easy-to-use, and powerful model for state-of-the-art stream and batch processing, portability across a variety of languages, and the ability to converge offline and nearline data processing.</p> <p>At LinkedIn, we have developed a Samza Runner to leverage the cutting-edge features of Beam. This runner combines the large-scale streaming processing capabilities and first-class state support in Samza with the advancements in Beam data processing. In this talk, we will discuss the Beam API and its implementation in Samza and the benefits of Beam Runner to the Samza and Beam community.</p> <p>7:15-7:50 PM: uReplicator: Uber Engineering’s Scalable Robust Kafka Replicator (Hongliang Xu, Uber)</p> <p>At Uber, we operate 20+ Kafka clusters to collect system and application logs as well as event data from rider and driver apps. We need a Kafka replication solution to replicate data between Kafka clusters across multiple data centers for different purposes. This talk will introduce the history behind uReplicator and the high level architecture. As the original uReplicator ran into scalability challenges and operational overhead as the scale of Kafka clusters increased, we built the Federated uReplicator which addressed above issues and provide an extensible architecture for further scaling.</p> <p>7:55-8:30 PM: Concourse - Near real time notifications platform at Linkedin (Ajith Muralidharan &amp; Vivek Nelamangala, LinkedIn)</p> <p>Concourse is LinkedIn’s first near-real-time targeting and scoring platform for notifications. In this talk, we will provide an in-depth overview of the design and discuss various scaling optimizations. We'll explain how Concourse can score millions of notifications per second, while supporting the use of feature-rich machine learning models based on terabytes of feature data.</p> <p>RSVP:<br/>Please RSVP *only* if you plan to attend in person. Our facility can host ~200 guests in Sunnyvale and ~70 guests in San Francisco.</p> <p>Parking:<br/>You can park in the uncovered parking that is along the building or in the parking garage located next to the building.</p> <p>NDA:<br/>You will need to sign a standard NDA when you enter the lobby.</p> <p>Food &amp; Drink:<br/>Food (pizza, wings) &amp; drink (water, beer, wine) will be provided.</p> <p>Live Stream:<br/>TBD</p> <p>Want to talk at a future meetup?:<br/>Please contact us via the “Contact” button in meetup.com.</p> ",

We are also seeking 30 speakers for the Data Science Camp, in October.</p> <p>Available dates for speakers in 2018:</p> <p>General Computing talks on 3rd Wed: 8/15, 9/19, 10/17, 11/28</p> <p>Data Science SIG talks on 4th Mon: 9/24, 10/22, 12/3</p> <p>ABOUT ACM &amp; SFbayACM</p> <p>The Association of Computing Machinery <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization</a> is the world’s largest computing society, handling Computer Science conferences and publications. The San Francisco Bay Area ACM is a local professional chapter, a non-profit 501c(3), founded in 1957. We hold two meetups a month on (1) General Computing on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, and (2) Data Science SIG, on data mining, deep learning or big data on the 4th Monday of the month. We generally have[masked] people attending our talks. See also our YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/sfbayacm\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/user/sfbayacm</a>) with ~120 past talks. Twice a year, we host a Saturday class, a Professional Development Seminar. We promote our talks to about 6,000 bay area computing professionals. Since 2009, we have been hosting the ACM Data Science Camp, a mini-conference for up to 410 participants and 28 speakers – in mid-October.</p> <p>SEEKING SPEAKERS<br/>In general, we are seeking speakers to book in advance. Talks could be like something you would see at a computing conference, an educational subject for experienced computing professionals. It is fine to err on the side of more technical, algorithmic or mathematical.<br/>If you would like to submit a talk proposal, provide the following:<br/>* 3 available dates (DS on 4th Monday of the month) or (General Computing on 3rd Wed of the month). We skip December for talks.<br/>* speaker name, phone, email, LinkedIn (or picture)<br/>* talk title<br/>* talk description (include any desired links, related reading)<br/>* speaker bio (include any desired links)</p> <p>CONTACT US:<br/>On the left side of the Meetup page, in the \"Organizers:\" box, there is a \"Contact\" button you can use for the submission, use \"general computing\" or \"DS SIG\" talk at the beginning to propose your talk.</p> <p>SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES<br/>You can also contact me (Greg Makowski) about sponsorship opportunities for our non-profit organization. We are run by unpaid volunteers. If you provide financial sponsorship, sponsor food or the video recording for a night or talk series, we can offer either<br/>a) a \"thank you for the donation letter with our 501c(3) non-profit tax ID\" for your tax deduction<br/>b) \"thank the sponsor\" time to address the event audience during the \"upcoming events\" period of one of our events (7:00 - 7:10)<br/>c) opt-in registration information of the attendees<br/>d) \"thank the sponsor\" branding on the video, posted on our YouTube video channel of our talks<br/>e) a banner in our monthly email newsletter to 6,000 opt-in bay area computing professionals or a section of our print newsletter to members only<br/>f) make a suggestion and we can see what we can do, constrained by our volunteer effort and non-profit status.</p> <p>Thanks, Greg Makowski, Business Development Lead and Data Science SIG Chair</p> ",

Hear from strong women leaders who beat the odds to succeed in STEM careers. Learn what's happening in academia to develop responsible AI that may fix Silicon Valley's gender gap.</p> <p>Our expert panel includes:</p> <p>Dr. James Zou, Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.</p> <p>Dr. Zou is part of the Stanford AI Lab and his pioneering research while at Microsoft helped define the emerging field of algorithm bias. His recent work analyzed 100 years of gender and ethnic stereotypes using word embeddings.</p> <p>Magaly Drant, Director of Engineering Operations at ServiceNow</p> <p>Magaly's one of a small group of engineering leaders responsible for developing products recently named \"Most Innovative Enterprise Technology\" by Forbes. Magaly joined the company in 2011 from HP and holds degrees in Math and Physics.</p> <p>Shannon Burns, Internal Tools Engineer at Slack</p> <p>Shannon joined a startup called Slack in 2016 that was recently valued at $5B. She was an early member of the Developer Relations team where she helped grow a platform and ecosystem that now boasts 1,500 apps and 200,000 weekly active developers.</p> <p>Moderator: Dan Turchin, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Astound</p> <p>Why are we hosting this event? Because it's about time everyone who cares about the future of work starts talking about the impact of AI on jobs, diversity, stereotypes, and bias.</p> <p>AI is making hiring decisions, keeping neighborhoods safe, and designing curricula in schools. As a community of AI developers, it's critical that we understand how these decisions are made.</p> <p>All \"intelligence\" behind AI requires people, algorithms, and data. We unintentionally bring our biases to work. The single biggest threat to broader adoption of AI technology is developers reinforcing cultural biases in the decision-making process.</p> <p>Everyone is welcome. Bring your kids. Bring your questions. Be inspired.</p> ",

Emitting and storing metrics is critically important for any application, but those metrics aren’t valuable on their own: they need to be actionable. Armory will also discuss how to apply statistical analysis to critical application metrics to make automated decisions and remove those pesky error-prone humans from the process altogether. Informatica will talk about our specific use case.</p> <p>4:30 Cocktails/Snacks<br/>4:50 Welcome<br/>5:00 Informatica Use Case<br/>5:20 RedLock Presentation<br/>5:40 Final Q/A<br/>5:45 - 6:15 Social Half Hour</p> <p>About our speakers:<br/>Isaac Mosquera is the CTO and Co-Founder of Armory.

Subhajeet will address user understanding and security monitoring structures in FreeBSD, OpenBSD, with NetBSD (also Windows NT and Mac OS X's Darwin). His new operating system has included both monolithic and microkernel, as a hybrid kernel. In particular, on system file access, legacy boot and secure boot. He notices that based on the Linux kernel, Android still has some noticeable security issues, including closed source vs open source. Currently it is not efficient enough for the user to \"get the job done\" anymore. Users do not want their desktops to be bombarded with notifications and unnecessary information. One of the elements of the new operating system includes Timed Notification System, which lets the user interact with the notification for a certain amount of time depending on what the user is working on.</p> <p>Speaker Bio<br/>Subhajeet Mukherjee is a 21 year old programmer, and an author. He is currently a student of Computer Science at Foothill College (A.S). He previously completed his freshman year at South Dakota State University. He also has course certification on Machine Intelligence from Stanford University. He has a patent pending in both U.S. and India regarding the method and underlying system of this Operating System. In 2012, he started a debate at TED’s website to discuss about the future of operating systems in Calcutta. In 2016, he received a letter of commitment from Brookings Economic Development Corporation, South Dakota regarding his system. Last year, he received a letter from the Former President of the United States, Barack Obama as he wished him good luck. He is the author of \"Not in a Smarter Us\" and \"Love Without Sensuality\". Both books talk about legacy operating systems and the limitation in the current operating systems.</p> <p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhajeet-mukherjee-ba65a36a/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhajeet-mukherjee-ba65a36a/</a><br/><a href=\"http://subhajeetmukherjee.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://subhajeetmukherjee.com</a></p> ",

In stark contrast, the brain works fine with single-lane nanoscale devices that are intermittently blocked (ion channels). Conjecturing that it achieves error-tolerance by combining analog dendritic computation with digital axonal communication, neuromorphic engineers (neuromorphs) began emulating dendrites with subthreshold analog circuits and axons with asynchronous digital circuits in the mid-1980s. Three decades in, they achieved a consequential scale with Neurogrid, the first neuromorphic system with billions of synaptic connections. Neuromorphs then tackled the challenge of mapping arbitrary computations onto neuromorphic chips in a manner robust to lanes intermittently--or even permanently--blocked by trapped electrons. Having demonstrated scalability and programmability, they now seek to encode continuous signals with spike trains in a manner that promises greater energy efficiency than all-analog or all-digital computing across a five-decade precision range.</p> <p>About the Speaker:<br/>Kwabena Boahen is a Professor of Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Brains in Silicon Lab. He is a neuromorphic engineer who is using silicon integrated circuits to emulate the way neurons compute, and linking the seemingly disparate fields of electronics and computer science with neurobiology and medicine. His lab developed Neurogrid, a specialized hardware platform created at Stanford that enables the cortex's inner workings to be simulated in real time--something outside the reach of even the fastest supercomputers. His interest in neural nets developed soon after he left his native Ghana to pursue undergraduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in 1985. He went on to earn a doctorate in Computation and Neural Systems at the California Institute of Technology in 1997. From 1997 to 2005 he was on the faculty of University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA. With over ninety publications to his name, including a cover story in the May 2005 issue of Scientific American, his scholarship has been recognized by several distinguished honors, including the National Institute of Health Director's Pioneer Award in 2006. In 2016, he was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. His 2007 TED talk, A Computer that Works like the Brain, has been viewed over half-a-million times.</p> <p>Admission Fee:<br/>Open to all to attend<br/>(Online registration is needed.

Interested in presenting your work at a future Bay Area Research in NLP and ML Meetup? Click here: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/xtn1CrhyhLQk1D5i1\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/forms/xtn1CrhyhLQk1D5i1</a></p> <p>---<br/>Summary of this talk:<br/>Many problems combine Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Common ones include image and video captioning, image search, and reading text from videos. The approaches combining CV and NLP developed to solve these problems extend naturally to other domains, such as selecting the best thumbnail from videos and generating code from sketches of websites. Having led over 70 AI projects (including the ones above) at Insight, Emmanuel will go over some common approaches and pitfalls, diving deeper into some of the challenges that need to be overcome to get these models to work.</p> <p>---<br/>About Emmanuel Ameisen:<br/>Emmanuel Ameisen is the AI Lead at Insight. Emmanuel has years of experience going from product ideation to effective implementations. At Insight, he has led over 70 AI projects in a variety of domains, with Fellows that have gone on to join top ML teams around the country. Previously, he implemented and scaled out predictive analytics and machine learning solutions for Local Motion and Zipcar. Emmanuel holds master’s degrees in artificial intelligence, computer engineering, and management from three of France’s top schools.</p> <p>---<br/>About this Meetup group:<br/>Organized by the AI team at Mya Systems, this Meetup group is looking to bring together people testing and iterating novel approaches for potential applications in Artificial Intelligence. Come network, listen to what folks are working on, and learn from interactive sessions with experts in NLP &amp; ML.</p> ",

Data Studio lets users build live, interactive dashboards with beautiful data visualizations, for free. Users can fetch their data from a variety of sources and create unlimited reports in Data Studio, with full editing and sharing capabilities. Community Connectors is a feature for Data Studio that lets users use Apps Script to build connectors to any internet accessible data source. Developers can build, share, and publish their connectors. In this talk, we will give an overview of Data Studio, show how Community Connectors work, and show how anyone can connect to their data and visualize it in Data Studio.</p> <p>Talk: Applying Deep Convolutional Neural Nets to Video Games<br/>Description: In this talk, Farza will be going over how he created a tool named \"DeepLeague\" which applies convolutional neural nets to do object detection within video games using YOLO-net. He'll be going over the process of how he programmatically built a custom dataset of 100,000 images, trained a neural network from scratch, and released the tool for popular professional gaming teams to use.</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>Minhaz Kazi is the Developer Advocate for Google Data Studio. As a business intelligence veteran, Minhaz is always exploring new ways for developers to collect, analyze, and visualize data. He is available for long discussions on circular reference errors, benefits of pie charts, SQL commas, and design of everyday things.</p> <p>Hi! My name's Farza and I do lots of stuff :). Most recently, I've been doing lots of work in computer vision/deep learning and got my start in the field doing research in academia with self-driving cars. I then went on to apply deep learning to something I enjoy a lot: video games. I won't discuss it much here since that's what my talk is all about, but my work is currently being used by a number of professional gaming teams to help them improve their analytics. Other than vision, I love building augmented reality iOS apps in Swift and websites in Node :). I currently work for a y-combinator company as an engineer.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Our Code of Conduct is located at: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/google-developer-group-san-francisco/pages/26314241/Code_of_Conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/google-developer-group-san-francisco/pages/26314241/Code_of_Conduct/</a></p> ",

It is right across the street from where we used to meet. The main entrance glass doors are just to the right of the CVS at the corner for 20th and Webster. We will have a volunteer there to let you in. Call or text me at[masked] if you need help with directions.</p> <p>For this meetup, we'll continue discussing VBA, macros, and both simple and complex formulas. We'll also have time to discuss new topics that we are interested in. Please feel free to email me if you have any wish list items that you'd like to discuss, present, or ask questions about.</p> <p>We also invite you to bring an Excel example to share with us, whether it's a problem that you'd like us to all try to solve together, or a clever technique that you'd like to show us. If you bring your laptop, you can plug into the projector and use WiFi.</p> <p>Paid garage parking as well as free street parking (after 6pm) are both available. You may also walk to the office from the 19th Street BART.</p> <p>We will ask for an optional $1-$2 donation to cover Meetup website costs.</p> <p>We're looking forward to seeing you there!</p> <p>Dan</p> <p>PS - Let me know if you'd like to be a \"door person\" (that is, let people in from 5:45 - 6:15) in exchange for 1 hour of free Excel consultation.</p> ",

This way we can improve as a society. I work towards this goal of democratizing education every day.</p> <p>One of the most important and ubiquitous current topics is machine learning. There is a very common misconception and it is that machine learning is a complicated subject, only accessible to those with high programming and mathematical skills. This is entirely untrue; machine learning is just the adult version of connect-the-dots, and anybody with a high school education can learn and tackle problems in machine learning.</p> <p>At Udacity, I am the head of the Machine Learning Nanodegree Team. Our goal is to let everybody know that they can learn machine learning, and give them the right tools for that.</p> <p>Linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisgserrano/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisgserrano/</a></p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6:00 PM | Doors Open<br/>6:30 PM | Workshop Begins<br/>7:30 PM | 10 min Break<br/>8:30 PM | Networking<br/>9:00 PM | Doors Close</p> <p>PRE-REQUISITES<br/>* Basic/Intermediate algebra (useful but might not be necessary)<br/>* Basic Computer Skills (might share slides or jupyter notebook with students prior to workshop)</p> <p>Sponsors:</p> <p>Impact Hub</p> <p>Latinx in AI Coalition</p> <p>Latino Startup Alliance</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Join Couchbase and AWS to learn the basics of Kubernetes and the benefits of Amazon EKS for your Kubernetes projects. Plus, we will demonstrate how to deploy the Couchbase Operator on Amazon EKS and how to deploy a Couchbase cluster in Kubernetes.</p> <p>Speakers</p> <p>Nic Raboy, Organizer</p> <p>Senior Developer Advocate at Couchbase</p> <p>Arun Gupta, Guest Speaker</p> <p>Arun Gupta is a Principal Open Source Technologist at Amazon Web Services. He focuses on everything containers and open source at AWS. He is responsible for the CNCF strategy within AWS, and participates at CNCF Board and technical meetings actively. He has built and led developer communities for several years at Sun, Oracle, Red Hat and Couchbase. Prior to that he led engineering teams at Sun and is a founding member of the Java EE team.</p> <p>He has extensive speaking experience in more than 40 countries on myriad topics. Gupta also founded the Devoxx4Kids chapter in the USA and continues to promote technology education among children. An author of several books on technology, an avid runner, a globe trotter, a Java Champion, a JUG leader, Docker Captain, he is easily accessible at @arungupta on twitter.</p> <p>Shomari Liburd - Cloud Architect at Couchbase</p> <p>Shomari Liburd is interested in how technology may change the world rather than the current new trend. He started programming on a computer with two floppy disks and no hard drive the 80s. The cloud would have been great then and perhaps this is why he works with Cloud technologies now. Shomari has programmed in languages such as Fortran, scheme, PERL and Java, and is amazed at how different the technology landscape looks every five years. He often wonders about singularity and hopes that it will lead to the cure for all diseases (and the Knicks winning a championship in his lifetime).</p> <p>Agenda</p> <p>Getting Started with Amazon EKS (45 minutes) - Presented by Arun Gupta</p> <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a new managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS. First part of this session will provide an overview of Amazon EKS, why Amazon built it, and how it works. Attendees will learn about how IAM roles can be used for authentication with the cluster using kubectl and assigned to pods at runtime. Cluster visibility using CloudWatch logs and Cloud Trail will be explained. Pod networking using the open source CNI plugin as well as the AWS CLI commands to manage the cluster will be explained and shown. Attendees will learn how about master nodes autoscaling and manual scaling of worker nodes. Finally, the session will explain how an application can be easily deployed to this service maintaining upstream Kubernetes experience. This session will provide different ways how attendees can engage with AWS using different open source channels.</p> <p>Deploying and Running the Couchbase Autonomous Operator for Kubernetes on AWS EKS (45 minutes) - Presented by Shomari Liburd</p> <p>In the second portion of the meetup you’ll learn about how the Operator makes it easy to deploy a Couchbase cluster in Kubernetes. We’ll discuss how the Operator automates many administrative tasks. We’ll also demonstrate how to deploy the Operator on EKS.</p> <p>Next Steps</p> <p>If you don’t have an AWS account you can sign up here: <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free\" class=\"linkified\">https://aws.amazon.com/free</a> At the event we’ll also have some AWS credits available to get you started with Couchbase and AWS.</p> ",

To help us get some of the deep learning basics down (and much more), we're very happy to invite Oswald Campesato as our speaker for the month of July!</p> <p>About the talk :</p> <p>A fast-paced introduction to Deep Learning concepts, such as activation functions, cost functions, back propagation, and then a quick dive into CNNs. Basic knowledge of vectors, matrices, and derivatives is helpful in order to derive the maximum benefit from this session.</p> <p>Next we'll see a simple neural network using Keras, followed by an introduction to TensorFlow and TensorBoard. (Bonus points if you know Zorn's Lemma, the Well-Ordering Theorem, and the Axiom of Choice.)</p> <p>Skill level: Beginner-friendly</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Oswald is a former PhD Candidate (ABD) in Mathematics, an education junkie (6 degrees), and an author of 19 technical books. He has worked for Oracle, AAA, and Just Systems of Japan, along with various startups. He has lived/worked in 5 countries on three continents, and in a previous career he worked in South America, Italy, and the French Riviera, and has traveled to over 70 countries on six continents. He has worked from C/C++/Java developer to CTO, comfortable in 4 languages, and dreams of becoming fluent in Japanese. Currently he is working in an AI start-up, and is an instructor at UCSC for a Deep Learning (100% TensorFlow) course, and conducts training in Deep Learning and Android.</p> <p>Twitter: @ocampesato</p> ",

Developers just want to write and deploy their code. But typically, before you can deploy, you need to allocate the necessary infrastructure including provisioning machines, configuring storage, configuring networking, and so on—all just to run even one line of code. Fortunately, serverless comes to the rescue!</p> <p>This talk will explore how Containers, Functions and Serverless are changing software development, and how the Fn project combines these concepts to deliver a serverless framework that eliminates infrastructure concerns entirely. Built on Docker, Fn includes support for writing functions in popular programming languages. All you need is Docker and you're ready to go! With Fn's function==container approach we'll show how easy it is to deploy pre-existing components as functions.</p> <p>7:10 to 7:50 pm – Building Docker containers in a multi-tenant environments by Priya Wadhwa</p> <p>Building images from a standard Dockerfile typically relies upon interactive access to a Docker daemon, which can be hard to run in environments like CI systems or inside a Kubernetes cluster. This talk will cover a variety of tools, including kaniko, img, FTL, bazel, buildah and orca-build, which can be used to build container images without a Docker daemon. It will cover the trade-offs of using each tool, and then explore how kaniko works more deeply, with a demo of using kaniko in Kubernetes and gvisor</p> <p>7:50 to 8:30 pm – Managing containers on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure by Jamal Arif</p> <p>In this session, we are going to discuss how you can manage your containers on Oracle cloud leveraging Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) and OCI Registry service.</p> <p>OKE is a managed Kubernetes service running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It enables customers to quickly create, manage and consume Kubernetes Clusters that leverage OCI compute, network and storage services, allowing them to focus on deploying and running their containerized applications without having to deploy and maintain their own container orchestration layer. OKE works in conjunction with the OCI Registry, a highly available Docker v2 container registry service, where customers can store their Docker images to launch containers on OKE.</p> <p>About the speakers:</p> <p>Varun Madan is the engineering lead for Oracle Functions, a service based on Fn Project (fnproject.io). Over the past 2 years, he has been building container native applications and services at Oracle. Before this, he spent 8 years at Amazon Web Services building different parts of EC2. Varun is @madvar on twitter.</p> <p>Priya Wadhwa is a software engineer on the Container Tools team at Google, where she maintains kaniko and works on other tools for building and testing containers.</p> <p>Jamal is part of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (IaaS) product management organization, and works with engineering and sales to define the product road map, market positioning and technical enablement program initiatives. Prior to joining Oracle, Jamal was with a software defined networking startup specializing in developing large scale cloud infrastructures. He has a Masters in Computer Networks and is an alumnus of the U.S government’s flagship Fulbright program.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Hosted By<br/>Nikhil Vaze, Community Leader</p> <p>Urvashi Singh, Community Leader</p> <p>Kriti Krishna, Program Manager – Developer Meetups (Oracle)</p> <p>---</p> <p>THIS IS A FREE EVENT - PLEASE FINISH YOUR RSVP IN THE LINK BELOW<br/><a href=\"https://events.docker.com/events/details/docker-santa-clara-presents-building-containers-deploying-serverless-applications-managing-containers-in-the-cloud\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.docker.com/events/details/docker-santa-clara-presents-building-containers-deploying-serverless-applications-managing-containers-in-the-cloud</a></p> ",

California's coast and ocean are among our most treasured resources. The productivity, wildness and beauty found here is central to California's identity, heritage and economy. California MPAs were designed by local stakeholders with guidance and feedback from scientists, managing agencies, experts, policymakers, and the general public, to achieve goals set forth in California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). By protecting sensitive ocean and coastal habitat, marine life flourishes and, in turn, creates a healthier system overall.</p> <p>WHAT IS MPA WATCH?<br/>MPA Watch is a citizen science program.</p> <p>MPA Watch staff train volunteers to observe and collect unbiased data on coastal and marine resource use, including collecting valuable data on ocean users and their activities, such as surfing, kayaking, fishing, boating, running, etc.</p> <p>The Marin MPA Watch is focused on MPA's in Marin County, CA, including around Limantour and Drakes beaches, Drakes Estero, the Point Reyes Headlands and Chimney Rock, Point Resistance, Agate County Beach and Corte Madera Marsh.</p> <p>Specifically, the Marin MPA Watch volunteers will observe and record both consumptive and non-consumptive offshore and onshore activities in and around MPAs, which will improve our understanding of how people are using these new MPAs.</p> <p>Data are meant to inform the management, enforcement, and science of California's marine protected areas (MPAs) and allow us to see how human uses are changing as a result of MPA implementation. By involving local communities in this important work, MPA Watch programs inspire and empower stewardship, and educate citizens about California's ocean ecosystems.</p> <p>Not only do local volunteers learn about their coastal environment and become \"citizen scientists\" and stewards of the area, but they generate quantities of monitoring data that would not be possible under the current state budget.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>TOPIC: Growing Slack with Empathy</p> <p>How do you drive meaningful growth for your product? Slack Product Head Jules Walter shares frameworks he used to drive growth. He takes a stand against traditional approaches of scaling using a test and repeat approach. Instead, he advocates first developing a deep understanding of the problems preventing growth, and then using a structured approach to identify the best experiments to tackle those problems.</p> <p>About the Speaker: Jules leads the Monetization Team at Slack. He has been a key contributor to Slack's unprecedented growth in his over two years with the company. Prior to his work on monetization, Jules spearheaded the Mobile Growth Team. His team's work resulted in measurable improvements to new user onboarding and activation on mobile. He is passionate about improving diversity in tech and serves on the Board of CodePath.org, a nonprofit building the largest pipeline of high-performing, underrepresented software engineers in the industry.</p> <p>RSVP and get your tickets here:</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Come join us for a weekly open programming session at the Berkeley Library, Tarea Hall Pittman South Branch, in their Community Room. The library is close to Ashby BART station. See below for parking information.</p> <p>This meetup will be a self-directed programming session without a fixed plan or leader. Just bring whatever tutorials, books, courses, or projects that you're working on. You can meet people, find a partner for pair programming, talk about technology, or just work on a project or tutorial. All levels are welcome.</p> <p>Optional activity: if you want to work on coding puzzles, projects, and/or study groups with other attendees, let an organizer know when you arrive. You can also join the Code Self Study clan on codewars: <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/codewars\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/codewars</a></p> <p>Sometimes there are short lightning talk presentations (5-10 minutes long) at the beginning of the meetup. To submit a presentation idea, fill out this form: <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/presentations</a></p> <p>Sometimes the meetings are quiet and sometimes there is talking. If you are depending on silence, you might want to bring headphones or earplugs.</p> <p>We often walk over to a nearby cafe for more programming at 1 pm.</p> <p>Parking Information: There is free parking on the back streets near the library. If you head west on Russell Street for a couple of blocks, you should be able to find free all-day parking. There is also free parking to the north and east of the library. Keep an eye out for street sweeping signs. Here is a map that shows a free parking area marked in gray: <a href=\"https://codeselfstudy.com/parking\" class=\"linkified\">https://codeselfstudy.com/parking</a></p> ",
