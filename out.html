<P>Global Medical Device Regulations continue to evolve, as devices become more diverse and sophisticated. Understanding the regulations and requirements in your targeted markets will expedite speed-to-market of innovative products and assist patients needing access to life-saving products and technologies. Government Regulatory Authorities, needing to become more efficient with their time, are looking for ways to better use their internal resources without compromising safety in products, which become marketable. One such example is the Medical Device Single Audit Program [MDSAP], where Authorized Organizations would be allowed to carry out a single GMP audit on medical device manufacturing facilities and have it stand to support registrations across the current participating member countries: U.S. Canada, Brazil, Australia and Japan.</P>
<P>This two-day seminar is focused on understanding the Medical Device Single Audit Program, the scope of the program, how to apply, the Authorized Organizations, the rating system developed and what you can expect when signing onto the program. The seminar will discuss how such audits are organized, what to expect during a MDSAP audit, how does this differ from a typical certified body audit, along with document movement and timeline expectations in receiving the facility’s certificate.</P>
<P>The key Regulatory Requirements for Medical Devices will also be covered for the participating MDSAP Countries of: U.S., Canada, Brazil, Australia and Japan.</P>

<P>This time is the turn for <STRONG>Uber,</STRONG> <STRONG>Manager Marketing Analytics and Data Science, Mario Vinasco </STRONG>to share with us how Uber prepares its marketing budget using complex algorithms. Finance runs a process and allocates a marketing budget. The marketing team takes that as the total budget constraint and optimize across channels, cities and weeks for the quarter. This is run in a modern optimizer called CVXPY (http://www.cvxpy.org). The inputs to the optimizer are the estimates of channel efficiencies or cost curves that are obtained by fitting models to time series (using Bayesian methods and soon neural nets).</P>

<P>More about Hackbright Academy:  Hackbright Academy is an intensive software engineering school for women. Highly driven and accomplished women come to Hackbright to "pivot" in their careers.  </P>
<P>They complete a full-time, in-person, 12-week, 500-hour boot camp rooted in the programming language of Python with the focus of learning full-stack web application development. Fellows learn JavaScript as a secondary programming language as well as HTML/CSS and the templating language Jinja. Fellows learn software development techniques and technologies such as AJAX, *nix command-line, and how to work with APIs such as Google Maps and Twitter.</P>
<P>They learn the fundamentals of Computer Science data structures such as linked lists, dictionaries and trees, as well as object-oriented design. They also learn the fundamentals of basic networking concepts and how the internet works including the HTTP internet protocol. Techniques used in the industry such as pair programming, Git and version control, and deploying to cloud services such as Heroku are also components of the program.</P>
<P>Students learn how to write unit-tests, integration tests, and functional tests for their code, and many also explore Test-Driven Development techniques. To manage database structures, they learn SQL. In object-oriented design they learn how to master Object Relational Mapping techniques with the SQLAlchemy library.

This allows all the marketing teams that rely on AdStage to report and automate their performance data.</p> <p>SPEAKER BIO:</p> <p>Blake is a software engineer architecting and building systems at AdStage. He was accidentally exposed to PHP at the age of 12 when an online friend made him an admin of a fan website of a popular RTS game. Although he did not gain any superpowers from that experience, he has been coding in a form or another ever since. After spending multiple years banging out Ruby and Clojure code, he has found Elixir to represent the best elements of both languages, and has been a staunch advocate ever since.</p> <p>SCHEDULE:</p> <p>6pm Meetup Social - Food/Drinks<br/>7pm Talk begins</p> <p>WHERE:</p> <p>461 Bush St San Francisco, CA 94108, 4th Floor.

<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Lake started Stitch Fix in Harvard Business School, and often faced skepticism from a mostly male venture capital world as she pitched the concept of the data-driven fashion company targeted at women. Seven years after Katrina received her first term sheet, Stitch Fix is valued at more than $2 billion, and has shipped millions of ‘Fixes’: boxes of clothes and accessories personalized for clients using a unique combination of algorithms and human stylists.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Beyond its success with customers and investors, Stitch Fix’s workforce is 86 percent female, and the company also focuses on representation in its leadership, maintaining a 50/50 split of men and women on its board.

A key question in climate science is How much global warming should we expect for a given increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide? One strategy for addressing this question is to run physical models of the global climate system but these models vary in their estimates of future warming by about a factor of two. Our research has attempted to narrow this range of uncertainty around model-projected future warming and to assess whether the upper or lower end of the model range is more likely. We showed that there are strong statistical relationships between how models simulate fundamental features of the Earth's energy budget over the recent past, and how much warming models simulate in the future. Importantly, we find that models that match observations the best over the recent past, tend to simulate more warming in the future than the average model. Thus, statistically combining information from physical models and observations tells us that we should expect more warming (with smaller uncertainty ranges) than we would expect if we were just looking at physical models in isolation and ignoring observations.</p> <p>Speaker Bio</p> <p>Patrick is a postdoctoral research scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford.

<P>Global Medical Device Regulations continue to evolve, as devices become more diverse and sophisticated. Understanding the regulations and requirements in your targeted markets will expedite speed-to-market of innovative products and assist patients needing access to life-saving products and technologies. Government Regulatory Authorities, needing to become more efficient with their time, are looking for ways to better use their internal resources without compromising safety in products, which become marketable. One such example is the Medical Device Single Audit Program [MDSAP], where Authorized Organizations would be allowed to carry out a single GMP audit on medical device manufacturing facilities and have it stand to support registrations across the current participating member countries: U.S. Canada, Brazil, Australia and Japan.</P>
<P>This two-day seminar is focused on understanding the Medical Device Single Audit Program, the scope of the program, how to apply, the Authorized Organizations, the rating system developed and what you can expect when signing onto the program. The seminar will discuss how such audits are organized, what to expect during a MDSAP audit, how does this differ from a typical certified body audit, along with document movement and timeline expectations in receiving the facility’s certificate.</P>
<P>The key Regulatory Requirements for Medical Devices will also be covered for the participating MDSAP Countries of: U.S., Canada, Brazil, Australia and Japan.</P>

<P>Biologics continue to be a steadily growing component of the pharmaceutical industry. The advent of large molecule therapeutics requires a different perspective on the assays needed to support development through preclinical and clinical testing.</P>
<P>This 2-day seminar is designed to offer a broad overview of developing and validating a range of assay methodologies for biologics with specific key analysis of cell culture, assay variability, and DOE. Specifically, this seminar covers essential concepts related to cell-based potency methods, ELISA, and other methods supporting biologics. In addition to potency methods this seminar addresses immunogenicity methods for preclinical and clinical studies. The format of the seminar offers an examination of current best practices as well as time to dissect examples of documentation with emphasis on beneficial systems to consider. Scientists who attend this 2-day seminar will gain knowledge that will be beneficial in helping to achieve well-controlled validated methods.</P>

<P><BR></P>
<P>The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP), Module IV requires that risk-based audits of the quality system be performed at regular intervals to assure that it complies with the established quality requirements and to determine its effectiveness. It includes audit of the pharmacovigilance system which is covered by the quality system. The GVP Modules are applicable to EU-based companies and any company marketing medicinal products on a global basis. The legally required risk based audit strategy shall cover all PV processes and tasks undertaken by or delegated to other departments, MAH affiliates, and third parties such as distributors, external service providers, partners (the PV Universe). The PV Audit Strategy Plan is used to prepare the PV audit program, i.e. annual PV Audit Schedule.</P>
<P>In this two day workshop conference we will review the EMA and FDA requirements regarding Risk Based Audits of the PV system and Quality System. The course will focus on the design of the PV audit strategy, identification of the PV processes and entities subject to PV audit (define the PV audit universe), development of risk assessment methodology, development of procedures/tools to monitor PV processes and activities, and implementation of the PV audit strategy plan. Additionally, we will review methods of quality oversight and management of third parties performing PV activities..</P>

This event will focus on the SQL Big Data Engine, Presto, and featuring some seriously delicious beers. The talks will be given by two Lead Data Engineers from Qubole on various open-source features and tools they’ve optimized Presto for servicing hundreds of users each day.</p> <p>We'll explore the state of Presto today and optimizations that Qubole is driving to make it a first class tool. Focusing on the challenges looking into the future of Presto in 2018, as well as OSS examples and best practices that help optimize Presto for different big data workloads.</p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6-6:30 pm - Networking (drinks + snacks)<br/>6:30-7:00 pm - Session 1<br/>7:00-7:30 pm Session 2<br/>7:30-8:00 pm - Q&amp;A<br/>8:00-8:30 pm - Networking</p> <p>Session 1<br/>Title: SQL Join Optimizations in Qubole Presto<br/>Speaker: Amogh Margoor, Staff Engineer</p> <p>Abstract: SQL Joins are a common and critical component of interactive SQL workloads. The Qubole Presto team has worked on two important JOIN optimizations to dramatically improve the performance of queries on Qubole Presto. We will talk about 2 join optimizations introduced in Qubole Presto:<br/>• Join Reordering<br/>• Dynamic Filtering</p> <p>We also present improvement in runtime of TPC-DS queries due to these join optimizations. Specifically we show that:<br/>• Join Reordering provides a maximum improvement of 6X.<br/>• Dynamic Filtering provides 2.8X geomean improvement and 14X maximum improvement.<br/>• Due to better resource utilization from these optimizations, Qubole Presto can now run 90 TPC-DS queries compared to 72 without these optimizations.</p> <p>About -<br/>Amogh Margoor is yet another Software Developer (YASD) currently working at Qubole. His area of interests are Compilers, Big Data Engines and SQL Optimizers. At Qubole he has worked on the internals of Hive and Presto. Specifically, he has worked on join optimizations like Dynamic Filtering and Join Reordering, Join Distribution types, Materialized Views, OLAP Cubes, Auto-Tuning Big Data Stack, infrastructure for AIR (data intelligence and QDS internal Data warehouse), Big Data Engine Optimizations for cloud etc.</p> <p>Session 2<br/>Speaker/Role: Abhishek Das, Software Engineering Team Lead</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Abhishek will discuss some deeper insights into the use cases for Apache Presto. Abhishek will share Qubole open-source and internal optimizations made to improve Presto for different SQL workloads to 2.5x performance improvement (ETL, ad-hoc, and reporting).</p> <p>Specifically, he will dive into performance improvement in Presto due to caching solution such as Rubix (an open-source solution for caching in Spark and Presto). As well as share empirical data on the efficacy of these optimizations and lessons learned from running columnar caches at scale that led to the design of Rubix.</p> <p>About -<br/>Abhishek Das is a Software Engineering Team Lead for Rubix at Qubole. He has developed large-scale implementations for Hadoop 2, Hive and Tez. Currently, Abhishek focuses on developing solutions to improve the performance of Apache Presto and Spark. Abhishek has worked on many massive-scale projects, helping companies implement ETL and analytics big data clusters for the past 4-years at Qubole.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-machine-learning-tickets-46298125941?aff=ebapi target=blank>Introduction to Machine Learning</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-21T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P><SPAN>This is a</SPAN><SPAN>n absolute beginner's guide to machine learning for the enterprise. </SPAN><SPAN>Come join our</SPAN><SPAN> strategic and design-thinking inspired conversation for beginners to explore and apply machine learning at </SPAN><SPAN>your enterprise!

Multi-master configuration or use of a separate NoSQL DB (for multi-region data distribution) are common solutions. However, none of these solutions achieve the desired business outcomes of high customer satisfaction, increased data protection, and regulatory compliance.</p> <p>YugaByte DB, a new open source transactional DB, delivers the above business outcomes with ease. It does so by bringing together the best of SQL and NoSQL worlds into a unified DB. On one hand, it accelerates application development through multiple APIs (YSQL, Redis &amp; PostgreSQL) that have built-in RDBMS-like data safety as well as have flexible data management features such as JSON data type, secondary indexes, Time-To-Live and tunable read latency. On the other hand, it also enables cloud-native operational agility through automated provisioning of multi-region/multi-cloud clusters combined with extreme fault-tolerance for ensuring zero downtime and zero data loss in dynamic cloud environments.</p> <p>This session will highlight how geo-distributed cloud apps can get started with YugaByte DB's recent 1.0 release and thereafter future-proof their DB needs for years to come. A real-world E-Commerce app built on the YERN (YugaByte DB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack will be used as an example.</p> <p>SPEAKER:<br/>Karthik Ranganathan (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kranganathan/" class="linkified">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kranganathan/</a>), Co-Founder &amp; CTO of YugaByte, is a highly experienced database and distributed systems engineer who built much of Facebook's Apache HBase-based NoSQL platform.

<P>– Autopilot (Car will follow other cars, stop itself if car stops in front of it, follow the lane even with turns, and etc. )</P>
<P>– Auto parking (Car can park itself automatically both parallel and perpendicular).</P>
<P>– Auto summon (Car can move few yards back and forth by its own / no driver inside.)</P>
<P>A test drive will take place in a parking lot and city streets next to our office in San Mateo (We are located in a quiet business district, with the minimal traffic, and this makes this experience easy and stress-free.)</P>
<P>Your participants will be behind driving wheel during autopilot mode. One of our representatives will be present in the car all the time to advise.</P>
<P>Every participant who is willing to test drive Tesla should have a driving license valid for driving in US. (I.e. valid for renting cars in US).</P>

This flexibility led to unwanted differences in processes and deployments, creating inconsistent or suboptimal performance. The United Kingdom’s government recognized the importance of perceiving IT as a service and then applying consistent practices across the entire IT service lifecycle, and initiated ITIL.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN><BR> ITIL encompasses a framework of five core publications or ITIL books, which are periodically reviewed and updated as technologies change. Each book collects best practices for each major phase of the IT service lifecycle. ITIL Service Strategy explains business goals and customer requirements. ITIL Service Design shows how to move strategies into plans that help the business. ITIL Service Transition shows how to introduce services into the environment. ITIL Service Operation explains how to manage the IT services. ITIL Continual Service Improvement helps adopters evaluate and plan large and small improvements to IT services.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>ITIL-based IT infrastructure management can be a complex specialty for any business, and is often the domain of the largest IT-centric businesses such as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and IBM, along with other major enterprises in retail, finance, pharmaceuticals, entertainment and manufacturing. ITIL adoption and maintenance normally requires trained and certified experts to guide a company and its IT staff.</SPAN></P>

This newly-labeled data is used to continuously train and deploy new models.</p> <p>We will use PipelineAI and Istio with Kubernetes to quickly - and safely - deploy the new models to a live production environment.</p> <p>Similar to canary deployments of classic microservices, the new models are exposed to only a small amount of production traffic. Slowly, we will shift more traffic to the new models.</p> <p>Using reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits, and metrics from Prometheus/Grafana, live traffic is automatically routed to the winning models based on a given reward function such as MAXIMIZE(number of signups) or MINIMIZE(cost per prediction).</p> <p>All demos run on a hybrid-cloud, open source, GPU-based, Kubernetes cluster optimized for the machine learning and artificial intelligence use cases that we commonly see at PipelineAI.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Chris Fregly is Founder and Applied AI Engineer at PipelineAI, a Real-Time Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Startup based in San Francisco.</p> <p>He is also an Apache Spark Contributor, a Netflix Open Source Committer, founder of the Global Advanced Spark and TensorFlow Meetup, author of the O’Reilly Training and Video Series titled, "High Performance TensorFlow in Production with Kubernetes and GPUs."</p> <p>Previously, Chris was a Distributed Systems Engineer at Netflix, a Data Solutions Engineer at Databricks, and a Founding Member and Principal Engineer at the IBM Spark Technology Center in San Francisco.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <p>Decent grasp of Computer Science.</p> <p>A good night's sleep!</p> <p>More Info</p> <p>Web: <a href="http://pipeline.ai/workshops" class="linkified">http://pipeline.ai/workshops</a></p> <p>Email: [masked]</p> <p>**Everybody gets their own cloud-based GPU/TPU for the day!!</p> <p>MUST RSVP HERE: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-continuously-train-deploy-tensorflow-serverless-models-in-production-with-kafka-openfaas-tickets-42772365296" class="linkified">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-continuously-train-deploy-tensorflow-serverless-models-in-production-with-kafka-openfaas-tickets-42772365296</a></p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/information-technology-infrastructure-libraryitil-live-weekend-online-training-for-la-mesa-june-23-tickets-45797465452?aff=ebapi target=blank>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE LIBRARY(ITIL) Live weekend online Training for La mesa-June 23-24,2018</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-23T09:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P><SPAN>ITIL traces its roots back to the 1980s as data centers began decentralizing and adopting more distributed or geographically diverse architectures.

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Contra Costa County and the cities of Walnut Creek, Antioch, Concord, and Pittsburg, as well as the housing authorities of the County of Contra Costa, Cities of Pittsburg &amp; Richmond, are currently working together to conduct an regional fair housing analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>This process will help the region to better understand its fair housing issues through data and mapping, community participation, and policy analysis. It will help draw up solutions to help address residential segregation, housing discrimination, and access to safe, stable housing. This analysis looks more closely at housing as it is experienced in real life. It also examines the connection to other issues, such as environmental health, good schools, jobs, and transportation access. We encourage people within the community to make their experiences and views on these issues heard. In addition, the shared information will help to inform the planning process within the county, participating cities, and public housing authorities.</SPAN></P>

Data warehouses are used to consolidate data located in disparate databases. A data warehouse stores large quantities of data by specific categories so it can be more easily retrieved, interpreted, and sorted by users. Warehouses enable executives and managers to work with vast stores of transactional or other data to respond faster to markets and make more informed business decisions. It has been predicted that every business will have a data warehouse within ten years. But merely storing data in a data warehouse does a company little good. Companies will want to learn more about that data to improve knowledge of customers and markets. The company benefits when meaningful trends and patterns are extracted from the data.</P>

These devices are expected to generate billions of petabytes of data traffic between cloud and edge devices. In 2017 alone, there were as many as 8.4B connected devices, highlighting the need to preprocess data at the edge. This has led many IoT device manufacturers, especially those working on vision-based devices like smart cameras, drones, robots, and AR/VR, to bring intelligence to the edge.</p> <p>Through the recent addition of the Movidius VPU technology to its existing AI edge solutions portfolio, Intel is well positioned to provide solutions to help developers and data scientists pioneer the low-power intelligent edge devices segment. Ashwin Vijayakumar gives you an overview of Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, a miniature deep learning hardware development platform that you can use to prototype, tune, and validate your AI programs (specifically deep neural networks).</p> <p>Topics covered in this session:<br/>1. How Movidius VPUs are pioneering DNN-accelerated vision processing<br/>2. Introduction to developer tools for Intel Movidius technology<br/>3. Live demo of deploying image classifiers on NCS<br/>4. Live demo of deploying object detectors on NCS<br/>5. How to run pre-trained and fine-tuned Caffe models on NCS<br/>6. How to run pre-trained and fine-tuned TensorFlow models on NCS<br/>7. Live demo of a smart security camera built using a Raspberry Pi Zero and NCS</p> <p>Preparation for the session (optional): If you already have an Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, and would like to replicate the live demos during the session, please install the Neural Compute SDK and download the sample repository. Instructions are available at <a href="https://developer.movidius.com/start" class="linkified">https://developer.movidius.com/start</a>.</p> <p>If you would like to replicate the Raspberry Pi Zero based smart security camera PoC, which I will demo during the session, visit these links:<br/>• Practical applications of deep learning at the edge<br/>• Source code and instructions to run the demo - <a href="https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo/tree/master/apps/security-cam" class="linkified">https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo/tree/master/apps/security-cam</a></p> <p>Speaker Bio: Entrepreneur, intrapreneur, maker, tinkerer, engineer! It's been fun wearing so many hats, but my best experiences have been 'enabling' people to bring their ideas to life by creating powerful prototyping platforms that are easy to use. Having spent a decade enabling startups and customers of fortune 500 companies across automotive, smart phones, robotics and IoT, I believe that given the right developer tools, everybody can develop innovative products.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Atlassian-Engineering-Nights/events/250888936/ target=blank>Frontend engineering night: tools to build rapidly & effectively</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-26T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>The Front End community has a great focus on tooling and dev experience. We as a front end community can learn from each other, and combine our efforts to make this even better!</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>Ellie Day:<br/>Ellie Day is a Senior Software Engineer at Atlassian Statuspage. She has extensive product building experience and often gives talks and workshops on various technical topics. Additionally, she’s passionate about helping other women have fulfilling tech careers via her role as director of Women Who Code SF and her continued mentorship of those breaking into tech.</p> <p>Chloe Condon:<br/>Former musical theatre actress and Hackbright Academy graduate, Chloe is now a Developer Evangelist at Sentry. Pre-Hackbright, she spent her nights and weekends performing in the Bay Area as a singer/actress and worked in tech by day. To support her theatre career, she started to learn to code on her own through online resources. Perhaps the only engineer you'll meet who has been in "Hairspray", "Xanadu", and "Jerry Springer: the Opera"- she is passionate about bringing people with non-traditional backgrounds into the world of tech. If you're trying to place her face, yes- she's the young woman giving the awkward thumbs up in the "What It's Like to be a Woman at a Tech Conference" article (which she also wrote). Chloe is also the organizer of TechLadyPicnic (a SF women in tech meet-up group), as well as the hostess/organizer of Sentry Scouts (a camp themed monthly tech meet-up... yes there are patches for each meet-up). In February of 2018 she was named one of the "200+ Thought Leaders in Crypto and Blockchain" and still knows absolutely nothing about Crypto and Blockchain... however, a quick Google search of her will provide you with getting started with Docker videos, observability articles, theatre reviews, tech blogs, and videos of her singing- enjoy!</p> <p>Schedule (TBD):</p> <p>6:00 - Welcome &amp; networking</p> <p>6:30 - Chloe Condon</p> <p>7:30 - Ellie Day</p> <p>8:00 - Check out the new office, grab some FREE food and drinks</p> <p>Code of Conduct:</p> <p>Atlassian is fully dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

Hear from strong women leaders who beat the odds to succeed in STEM careers. Learn what's happening in academia to develop responsible AI that may fix Silicon Valley's gender gap.</p> <p>Our expert panel includes:</p> <p>Dr. James Zou, Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.</p> <p>Dr. Zou is part of the Stanford AI Lab and his pioneering research while at Microsoft helped define the emerging field of algorithm bias. His recent work analyzed 100 years of gender and ethnic stereotypes using word embeddings.</p> <p>Magaly Drant, Director of Engineering Operations at ServiceNow</p> <p>Magaly's one of a small group of engineering leaders responsible for developing products recently named "Most Innovative Enterprise Technology" by Forbes. Magaly joined the company in 2011 from HP and holds degrees in Math and Physics.</p> <p>Shannon Burns, Internal Tools Engineer at Slack</p> <p>Shannon joined a startup called Slack in 2016 that was recently valued at $5B. She was an early member of the Developer Relations team where she helped grow a platform and ecosystem that now boasts 1,500 apps and 200,000 weekly active developers.</p> <p>Moderator: Dan Turchin, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Astound</p> <p>Why are we hosting this event? Because it's about time everyone who cares about the future of work starts talking about the impact of AI on jobs, diversity, stereotypes, and bias.</p> <p>AI is making hiring decisions, keeping neighborhoods safe, and designing curricula in schools. As a community of AI developers, it's critical that we understand how these decisions are made.</p> <p>All "intelligence" behind AI requires people, algorithms, and data. We unintentionally bring our biases to work. The single biggest threat to broader adoption of AI technology is developers reinforcing cultural biases in the decision-making process.</p> <p>Everyone is welcome. Bring your kids. Bring your questions.

I am sharing what I've experienced developing my career and advice that has helped me get where I am now. The goal is to get you thinking about your career paths in ways you haven't considered.</p> <p>Talk 2: From physics to data science - a numbers journey (Kasia Rachuta)<br/>Prior to starting my career in tech, I worked for the UK equivalent of the National Science Foundation; completed a couple of internships in social impact measurement and volunteered in Spain, Kenya and London. After I finished my master's, I decided to try something new and that's how I found myself in data science. I will cover being self-taught, what resources have helped me get where I am, as well as touch on the importance of mentorship and advocating for yourself.</p> <p>Talk 3: What I learned from every job I held and how that shaped who I am today (Raquel Araujo)<br/>My journey into data science was not a typical one. But whose is it, anyway? When I was looking for a job in a tech company, I had to market myself as ready for the industry after spending several years in academia. At the same time, I had to learn to navigate the previously unknown (to me) whiteboard interviews, homework assignments, coding challenges, etc. I want to share what I learned from every step in my career with other people who may find themselves in a similar situation.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Startup-Idea-to-IPO/events/251734087/ target=blank>Venture Capital Panel:  Funding for Machine Learning Startups</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-26T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE EVENT DESCRIPTION.</p> <p>There is a cover charge for this event.</p> <p>A "YES" RSVP on our meetup site does not confirm your reservation.</p> <p>Space is limited.

Given the sheer volume of online and offline events that need to be tracked while planning and executing ad campaigns; the unprecedented amount of decisions that need to be made in real-time; and the Internet-scale analytics that needs to be performed before, during, and after each campaign; this industry could not have arrived at its current level of maturity without all the recent advances in big data technologies.</p> <p>With data playing the central role in today’s digital advertising, a very important class of services has emerged in the advertising landscape: Data Management Platforms, or DMPs. The purpose of a DMP is to seamlessly (and rapidly) collect, integrate, analyze, and activate large volumes of data to ultimately make advertising as effective as possible.</p> <p>This tutorial will cover in detail the challenges involved in building a modern data management platform for digital advertising, and some of the high-impact research opportunities that exist in this Space.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/girl-geek-x-squaretrade-dinner-women-in-leadership-panel-tickets-46098264149?aff=ebapi target=blank>Girl Geek X SquareTrade Dinner & Women in Leadership Panel</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-27T17:30:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P><STRONG>Join the Women in Leadership team at SquareTrade for an evening of food, drinks, networking, and thought-provoking panel discussion.

You will then be sent an eNDA which needs to be signed 24 hours before the event, for security reasons. A badge would be pre-printed for you when you arrive at the event. Please register here.</p> <p>Talk #1: Foundations of streaming SQL or: How I learned to love stream and table theory</p> <p>This talk will address all of those questions in two parts.<br/>First, we’ll explore the relationship between the Beam Model (as described in The Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 blog posts) and stream &amp; table theory (as popularized by Martin Kleppmann and Jay Kreps, etc., but essentially originating out of the database world).</p> <p>Second, we’ll apply our clear understanding of that relationship towards explaining what is required to provide robust stream processing support in SQL. We’ll discuss concrete efforts that have been made in this area by the Apache Beam, Calcite, and Flink communities, compare to other offerings such as Kafka KSQL &amp; Spark Structured streaming, and talk about new ideas yet to come.</p> <p>In the end, you can expect to have a much better understanding of the key concepts underpinning data processing, regardless of whether that data processing batch or streaming, SQL or programmatic, as well as a concrete notion of what robust stream processing in SQL looks like.</p> <p>Speaker: Tyler Akidau(Google)<br/>Tyler Akidau is a staff software engineer at Google Seattle. He leads technical infrastructure’s internal data processing teams (MillWheel &amp; Flume), is a founding member of the Apache Beam PMC, and has spent the last seven years working on massive-scale data processing systems. He is the author of the 2015 Dataflow Model paper and the Streaming 101 and Streaming 102 articles on the O’Reilly website. His preferred mode of transportation is by cargo bike, with his two young daughters in tow.</p> <p>Talk #2: Kinesis at Lyft</p> <p>This talk will focus on how we used Amazon Kinesis to build the pub-sub infra at Lyft, that ingests more than a 100 billion events per day. We'll review the strengths and weaknesses of Kinesis as a choice for streaming events in realtime, at Lyft's scale; as well as the best practices and lessons learnt over time.</p> <p>Speaker: Hafiz Hamid (Lyft)</p> <p>Hafiz Hamid is a software engineer on the Pub-Sub/Streaming Platform team at Lyft. He has built some of the key pieces in the messaging &amp; streaming infrastructure at Lyft. Previously, Hafiz was a technical lead at Bing Search where he worked on data pipelines, relevance and web crawlers.</p> <p>Talk #3: Data all over the place! How Apache Calcite brings SQL and sanity to streaming and spatial data</p> <p>The revolution has happened. We are living the age of the deconstructed database. The modern enterprises are powered by data, and that data lives in many formats and locations, in-flight and at rest, but somewhat surprisingly, the lingua franca for remains SQL. In this talk, Julian describes Apache Calcite, a toolkit for relational algebra that powers many systems including Apache Beam, Flink and Hive. He discusses some areas of development in Calcite: streaming SQL, materialized views, enabling spatial query on vanilla databases, and what a mash-up of all three might look like.</p> <p>Speaker: Julian Hyde (Looker)</p> <p>Julian Hyde is an expert in query optimization and in-memory analytics.

In stark contrast, the brain works fine with single-lane nanoscale devices that are intermittently blocked (ion channels). Conjecturing that it achieves error-tolerance by combining analog dendritic computation with digital axonal communication, neuromorphic engineers (neuromorphs) began emulating dendrites with subthreshold analog circuits and axons with asynchronous digital circuits in the mid-1980s. Three decades in, they achieved a consequential scale with Neurogrid, the first neuromorphic system with billions of synaptic connections. Neuromorphs then tackled the challenge of mapping arbitrary computations onto neuromorphic chips in a manner robust to lanes intermittently--or even permanently--blocked by trapped electrons. Having demonstrated scalability and programmability, they now seek to encode continuous signals with spike trains in a manner that promises greater energy efficiency than all-analog or all-digital computing across a five-decade precision range.</p> <p>About the Speaker:<br/>Kwabena Boahen is a Professor of Bioengineering and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Brains in Silicon Lab. He is a neuromorphic engineer who is using silicon integrated circuits to emulate the way neurons compute, and linking the seemingly disparate fields of electronics and computer science with neurobiology and medicine. His lab developed Neurogrid, a specialized hardware platform created at Stanford that enables the cortex's inner workings to be simulated in real time--something outside the reach of even the fastest supercomputers. His interest in neural nets developed soon after he left his native Ghana to pursue undergraduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in 1985. He went on to earn a doctorate in Computation and Neural Systems at the California Institute of Technology in 1997. From 1997 to 2005 he was on the faculty of University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA. With over ninety publications to his name, including a cover story in the May 2005 issue of Scientific American, his scholarship has been recognized by several distinguished honors, including the National Institute of Health Director's Pioneer Award in 2006. In 2016, he was named a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers and of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. His 2007 TED talk, A Computer that Works like the Brain, has been viewed over half-a-million times.</p> <p>Admission Fee:<br/>Open to all to attend<br/>(Online registration is needed.

Currently, there is an ongoing debate in industry on how such therapies should be regulated, in particular by the FDA or under the practice of medicine, under federal law or state law, and as drugs or simply biologics.</P>

<DIV>Big data and analytics applications require storage that can scale in capacity and performance to handle workload demands with high throughput to compute nodes coupled with read-after-write consistency and low-latency file operations. Many analytics workloads interact with data via a file interface, rely on file semantics such as file locks, and require the ability to write to portions of a file. Amazon EFS provides the elasticity and agility to scale for analytics workloads.

<P>Using three very different types of coffee roasters, we'll take some of our favorite Crown Jewels through the roasting process and taste the results together. Not only will the class involve a lot of hands-on time with each roaster, we'll also be tasting the results and comparing the divergent types of heat transfers.</P>
<P>Crown staff will be on hand to answer questions and advise while you explore the possibilities offered on these micro-machines:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ikawa Pro - the darling of the digital age, this Bluetooth hot air roaster uses precision technology for temperature curve programs. The free mobile app allows you to store your roast data and share profiles with friends and colleagues. A dream machine from the future!</LI>
<LI>Behmor - the entry-level radiant heat home roaster, making it easy for literally anyone to roast coffee with impressive results. We use this little beauty every week for our Crown Jewels, and its results speak for themselves.</LI>
<LI>Probat Sample Roaster - the gold standard for multi-roasting, this professional device remains the preferred method for sample evaluation. Its unique combination of gas heat and airflow make it a powerful tool for precision roasting.</LI>

Developers just want to write and deploy their code. But typically, before you can deploy, you need to allocate the necessary infrastructure including provisioning machines, configuring storage, configuring networking, and so on—all just to run even one line of code. Fortunately, serverless comes to the rescue!</p> <p>This talk will explore how Containers, Functions and Serverless are changing software development, and how the Fn project combines these concepts to deliver a serverless framework that eliminates infrastructure concerns entirely. Built on Docker, Fn includes support for writing functions in popular programming languages. All you need is Docker and you're ready to go! With Fn's function==container approach we'll show how easy it is to deploy pre-existing components as functions.</p> <p>7:10 to 7:50 pm – Building Docker containers in a multi-tenant environments by Priya Wadhwa</p> <p>Building images from a standard Dockerfile typically relies upon interactive access to a Docker daemon, which can be hard to run in environments like CI systems or inside a Kubernetes cluster. This talk will cover a variety of tools, including kaniko, img, FTL, bazel, buildah and orca-build, which can be used to build container images without a Docker daemon. It will cover the trade-offs of using each tool, and then explore how kaniko works more deeply, with a demo of using kaniko in Kubernetes and gvisor</p> <p>7:50 to 8:30 pm – Managing containers on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure by Jamal Arif</p> <p>In this session, we are going to discuss how you can manage your containers on Oracle cloud leveraging Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) and OCI Registry service.</p> <p>OKE is a managed Kubernetes service running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It enables customers to quickly create, manage and consume Kubernetes Clusters that leverage OCI compute, network and storage services, allowing them to focus on deploying and running their containerized applications without having to deploy and maintain their own container orchestration layer. OKE works in conjunction with the OCI Registry, a highly available Docker v2 container registry service, where customers can store their Docker images to launch containers on OKE.</p> <p>About the speakers:</p> <p>Varun Madan is the engineering lead for Oracle Functions, a service based on Fn Project (fnproject.io). Over the past 2 years, he has been building container native applications and services at Oracle. Before this, he spent 8 years at Amazon Web Services building different parts of EC2. Varun is @madvar on twitter.</p> <p>Priya Wadhwa is a software engineer on the Container Tools team at Google, where she maintains kaniko and works on other tools for building and testing containers.</p> <p>Jamal is part of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (IaaS) product management organization, and works with engineering and sales to define the product road map, market positioning and technical enablement program initiatives. Prior to joining Oracle, Jamal was with a software defined networking startup specializing in developing large scale cloud infrastructures. He has a Masters in Computer Networks and is an alumnus of the U.S government’s flagship Fulbright program.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Hosted By<br/>Nikhil Vaze, Community Leader</p> <p>Urvashi Singh, Community Leader</p> <p>Kriti Krishna, Program Manager – Developer Meetups (Oracle)</p> <p>---</p> <p>THIS IS A FREE EVENT - PLEASE FINISH YOUR RSVP IN THE LINK BELOW<br/><a href="https://events.docker.com/events/details/docker-santa-clara-presents-building-containers-deploying-serverless-applications-managing-containers-in-the-cloud" class="linkified">https://events.docker.com/events/details/docker-santa-clara-presents-building-containers-deploying-serverless-applications-managing-containers-in-the-cloud</a></p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/onetalk-june-e-commerce-in-fashion-how-technology-influences-fashion-industry-tickets-47089713601?aff=ebapi target=blank>OneTalk June: E-Commerce in Fashion How Technology Influences Fashion Industry</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-28T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <H2 CLASS="MsoNormal">「ONETALK June 2018」E-Commerce in Fashion How Technology Influences Fashion Industry</H2>

<P>This month, we share work by <STRONG>Ladislav Sutnar</STRONG> (1897–1976), a Czech-born designer and pioneer of information graphics. His contributions to modern systems of typography and iconography represent a paradigm shift in visual language; Sutnar deconstructed large quantities of convoluted data, then reconstructed the information to read as quickly and clearly as possible. We’ll feature both his early work from Prague (book designs and housewares), and his later work in New York including theoretical treatises and exquisite industrial catalogs for Sweets. As a bonus, you’ll discover the origin of putting telephone area codes in parentheses.</P>
<P>Doors at 6:00pm. Presentation begins promptly at 6:30pm.</P>

California's coast and ocean are among our most treasured resources. The productivity, wildness and beauty found here is central to California's identity, heritage and economy. California MPAs were designed by local stakeholders with guidance and feedback from scientists, managing agencies, experts, policymakers, and the general public, to achieve goals set forth in California's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). By protecting sensitive ocean and coastal habitat, marine life flourishes and, in turn, creates a healthier system overall.</p> <p>WHAT IS MPA WATCH?<br/>MPA Watch is a citizen science program.</p> <p>MPA Watch staff train volunteers to observe and collect unbiased data on coastal and marine resource use, including collecting valuable data on ocean users and their activities, such as surfing, kayaking, fishing, boating, running, etc.</p> <p>The Marin MPA Watch is focused on MPA's in Marin County, CA, including around Limantour and Drakes beaches, Drakes Estero, the Point Reyes Headlands and Chimney Rock, Point Resistance, Agate County Beach and Corte Madera Marsh.</p> <p>Specifically, the Marin MPA Watch volunteers will observe and record both consumptive and non-consumptive offshore and onshore activities in and around MPAs, which will improve our understanding of how people are using these new MPAs.</p> <p>Data are meant to inform the management, enforcement, and science of California's marine protected areas (MPAs) and allow us to see how human uses are changing as a result of MPA implementation. By involving local communities in this important work, MPA Watch programs inspire and empower stewardship, and educate citizens about California's ocean ecosystems.</p> <p>Not only do local volunteers learn about their coastal environment and become "citizen scientists" and stewards of the area, but they generate quantities of monitoring data that would not be possible under the current state budget.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Women-in-Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/events/251597740/ target=blank>Code and Coffee East Bay</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-06-30T10:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Come join us for some coding and coffee!

<DIV CLASS="kno-rdesc r-iVGW4mqnprzQ"><SPAN>In big data and computation, the social sciences saw a chance to grow up. Most of the things we think we know about humanity are based on pitifully little data, and as a consequence they’re not strong science, says Pentland, an author of the 2009 paper. It’s all stories and heuristics. But data and computational social science promised to change that. It’s what science always hopes for—not merely to quantify the now but to calculate what’s to come. Scientists can do it for stars and DNA and electrons; people have been more elusive.</SPAN></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="kno-rdesc r-iVGW4mqnprzQ"><BR></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="kno-rdesc r-iVGW4mqnprzQ"><SPAN><SPAN>Then they’d take the next quantum leap. Observation and prediction, if you get </SPAN><SPAN>really</SPAN><SPAN> good at them, lead to the ability to act upon the system and bring it to heel. It’s the same progress that leads from understanding heritability to sequencing DNA to genome editing, or from Newton to Einstein to GPS. That was the promise of Cambridge Analytica: to use computational social science to influence behavior. Cambridge Analytica said it could do it. It apparently cheated to get the data. And the catastrophe that the authors of that 2009 paper warned of has come to pass.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn’t catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN> The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python’s introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn’t catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN> The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python’s introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn’t catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN> The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python’s introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn’t catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN> The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python’s introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python’s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms and can be freely distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn’t catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN> The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python’s introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</SPAN></P>

Issue areas to be addressed will be: funding mechanisms, legal considerations, United Nations initiatives, public safety, regenerative agriculture, third world government accountability, environmental cleanup, clean tech, and nutrition. This event is intended to be an educational event for ultra high net worth individuals, their family offices, endowments, and institutional investors only. </P>
<P>When deciding what to invest in, a person should consider new technologies, new perspectives, and innovative solutions to the world's problems. Investing in impact blockchain solutions fits those criteria. Before investing, however, one should be fully educated about the subject and well networked in the industry. This investor bootcamp aims to provide those services. This is an educational event and there is a strict policy of non-solicitation.</P>
<P>Gathering family offices, endowment investment staff, and experts in the field from all over the world, this event will bring together a diverse crowd to learn about the cutting edge of innovation: making the world a better place through blockchain technologies. Through a partnership with Manatt, the Helped Hope LLC team has put together an agenda designed to educate and connect industry and subject matter experts.</P>

Data Studio lets users build live, interactive dashboards with beautiful data visualizations, for free. Users can fetch their data from a variety of sources and create unlimited reports in Data Studio, with full editing and sharing capabilities. Community Connectors is a feature for Data Studio that lets users use Apps Script to build connectors to any internet accessible data source. Developers can build, share, and publish their connectors. In this talk, we will give an overview of Data Studio, show how Community Connectors work, and show how anyone can connect to their data and visualize it in Data Studio.</p> <p>Talk: Applying Deep Convolutional Neural Nets to Video Games<br/>Description: In this talk, Farza will be going over how he created a tool named "DeepLeague" which applies convolutional neural nets to do object detection within video games using YOLO-net. He'll be going over the process of how he programmatically built a custom dataset of 100,000 images, trained a neural network from scratch, and released the tool for popular professional gaming teams to use.</p> <p>About the Speakers:</p> <p>Minhaz Kazi is the Developer Advocate for Google Data Studio. As a business intelligence veteran, Minhaz is always exploring new ways for developers to collect, analyze, and visualize data. He is available for long discussions on circular reference errors, benefits of pie charts, SQL commas, and design of everyday things.</p> <p>Hi! My name's Farza and I do lots of stuff :). Most recently, I've been doing lots of work in computer vision/deep learning and got my start in the field doing research in academia with self-driving cars. I then went on to apply deep learning to something I enjoy a lot: video games. I won't discuss it much here since that's what my talk is all about, but my work is currently being used by a number of professional gaming teams to help them improve their analytics. Other than vision, I love building augmented reality iOS apps in Swift and websites in Node :). I currently work for a y-combinator company as an engineer.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Our Code of Conduct is located at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/google-developer-group-san-francisco/pages/26314241/Code_of_Conduct/" class="linkified">https://www.meetup.com/google-developer-group-san-francisco/pages/26314241/Code_of_Conduct/</a></p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-future-of-ai-in-advertising-tickets-44748556136?aff=ebapi target=blank>The Future of AI in Advertising</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-07-11T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <H2><STRONG>WHAT</STRONG></H2>

<P><STRONG>Product Management for the Internet of Things (IoT) (with Daniel Elizalde)</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN>By 2020, it’s estimated that 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet. This phenomenon is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). With this explosive growth, consumer and industrial companies alike are seeking a new breed of product professionals who can make the unique strategic decisions that IoT products require, and manage the added complexity and risk that IoT products present.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>In this interactive workshop, you will learn to develop a strong IoT product strategy. You’ll learn to identify the biggest pitfalls companies face when building IoT products, along with the tools and knowledge to start addressing them right away. You’ll also gain hands-on experience using Daniel’s </SPAN><A HREF="https://techproductmanagement.com/iot-decision-framework/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow"><SPAN>IoT Decision Framework</SPAN></A><SPAN>, a step-by-step strategic framework for making IoT product decisions in areas such as business models, UX, security, and more.</SPAN> </P>

<P>More teams are moving toward a truly cross-functional product team model where the teams that develops the product (i.e. product manager, designers, software engineers) are the ones responsible for doing their own discovery. They do their own user research, connect their own experiments, and synthesize what they are learning week over week to support their daily product decisions.</P>
<P>In this workshop, you’ll learn how to develop the habits necessary to create a continuous feedback loop between your product development ideas and your customers. You’ll learn how to start with a research question on Monday and end with some answers by Friday, in a way that is sustainable every week of the year.</P>
<P>This workshop will mix real world case studies with hands-on exercises and discussion about your specific situations, to make sure that you go home with actionable takeaways. Come learn what the future of product discovery looks like.</P>
<P><STRONG>About your trainer:</STRONG> Teresa is a product discovery coach who helps teams adopt user-centered, hypothesis-driven product development practices. She works with companies of all sizes on integrating user research, experimentation, and the right analytics into the product development process resulting in better product decisions. Recent clients include Allstate, Capital One, The Guardian, and Snagajob.</P>
<P>Before becoming a coach, Teresa spent the majority of her career leading product and design teams at early-stage internet companies. Most recently, Teresa was VP of Products at AfterCollege, an Internet startup that helps college students find their first job. She was CEO of Affinity Circles, an online community provider for university alumni associations and a social recruiting service used by Fortune 500 companies. She also held product and design roles at Become.com and HighWire Press.</P>

<P><STRONG>User Research Interviews (with Steve Portigal)</STRONG></P>

<P>Interviewing is undeniably one of the most valuable and commonly used user research tools. Yet sometimes we forget that it’s a skill we need to learn, because it’s based on skills we think we have (talking or even listening). Often, it’s not taught or reflected on and so people tend to ‘wing it’ rather than develop their skills. Without good interviewing skills, research results may be inaccurate or reveal nothing new, suggesting the wrong design or business responses, or they may miss the crucial nuance that points to innovative breakthrough opportunities.</P>
<P>In this session, we’ll focus on the importance of rapport-building and listening and look at techniques for both. We will review different types of questions, and why you need to have a range of question types. This workshop will explore other contextual research methods that can be built on top of interviewing in a seamless way. We’ll try some practice exercises for improving your own interviewing skills. We’ll also practice observation of users in an environment.<BR> <BR><STRONG>About your trainer:</STRONG> Steve Portigal helps companies to think and act strategically when innovating with user insights. He is principal of Portigal Consulting and the author of two books: The classic Interviewing Users: How To Uncover Compelling Insights and new, Doorbells, Danger, and Dead Batteries: User Research War Stories. He's also the host of the Dollars to Donuts podcast, where he interviews people who lead user research in their organizations. Steve is an accomplished presenter who speaks about culture, innovation, and design at companies and conferences across the globe.</P>

<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>About the Course</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Who needs to attend?</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>The following professionals can go for this course:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><BR></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>What is this course about?</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time</SPAN><SPAN>.</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>

Subhajeet will address user understanding and security monitoring structures in FreeBSD, OpenBSD, with NetBSD (also Windows NT and Mac OS X's Darwin). His new operating system has included both monolithic and microkernel, as a hybrid kernel. In particular, on system file access, legacy boot and secure boot. He notices that based on the Linux kernel, Android still has some noticeable security issues, including closed source vs open source. Currently it is not efficient enough for the user to "get the job done" anymore. Users do not want their desktops to be bombarded with notifications and unnecessary information. One of the elements of the new operating system includes Timed Notification System, which lets the user interact with the notification for a certain amount of time depending on what the user is working on.</p> <p>Speaker Bio<br/>Subhajeet Mukherjee is a 21 year old programmer, and an author. He is currently a student of Computer Science at Foothill College (A.S). He previously completed his freshman year at South Dakota State University. He also has course certification on Machine Intelligence from Stanford University. He has a patent pending in both U.S. and India regarding the method and underlying system of this Operating System. In 2012, he started a debate at TED’s website to discuss about the future of operating systems in Calcutta. In 2016, he received a letter of commitment from Brookings Economic Development Corporation, South Dakota regarding his system. Last year, he received a letter from the Former President of the United States, Barack Obama as he wished him good luck. He is the author of "Not in a Smarter Us" and "Love Without Sensuality".

<H2>DEFCON Prep Series - Social Engineering Workshop</H2>
<P>Welcome to the SECTF WISP DEFCON Prep Series! Get ready for Social Engineering village with this talk and hands on mini OSINT CTF!</P>
<P>Social Engineering (SE) is one of the most severe threats to security and privacy because anyone can do it - even a noob. This talk outlines real-world SE examples, and seemingly innocuous information that could compromise a company. Learn the methods SEs use to mine data and exploit behavior to own targets, and how women are uniquely skilled as SEs - from a 2016 and 2017 DEFCON SE Capture the Flag winner. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>NOTE: If you would like to participate in the mini OSINT CTF we encourage you to bring a laptop. Participation is possible from a phone or tablet but using a laptop is easiest for our participants.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><SPAN>Rachel is the CEO &amp; Co-founder of SocialProof Security where she helps people and companies keep their data safe by training them on social engineering risks. Rachel also placed second two years in a row in the DEF CON hacking conference's Social Engineering Capture the Flag contest. In her remaining spare time, Rachel works as the Chair of the Board for the nonprofit Women in Security and Privacy (WISP) where she empowers women to lead the converging fields. After she gets to inbox zero, she watches David Lynch movies with her husband named Evan and pup named Snugs.</SPAN></P>

<H3>Description</H3>
<P>Every biopharmaceutical company has SOPs, and new staff members are told that the company “has to have them” and that each employee “has to follow them”. But why do there have to be SOPs and why must we follow them as written? And how can we do this effectively?</P>
<P>Most people naturally want to do a good job. Successful managers recognize this fact and seek to channel workers' efforts in ways that will benefit the business. Well-written standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide direction, improve communication, reduce training time, and improve work consistency. The purpose of a SOP is to provide detailed instructions on how to carry out a task so that any team member can carry out the task correctly every time. The SOP development process is an excellent way for managers, workers, and technical advisers to cooperate for everyone's benefit. A very positive sense of teamwork arises when these parties work together toward common goals.</P>
<P>Perhaps if everything always executed as planned then we would not need procedures, but this is not the case in the real world. An SOP or Standard Operating Procedure is used to ensure business processes are well thought through, that each task in a process is performed the same way every time, and important data is recorded, along with errors or deviations so corrective action can be taken. Standard operating procedures used in combination with planned training and regular performance feedback lead to an effective and motivated workforce. Managers and advisers benefit from consistent work performance and predictable results. Workers benefit from increased confidence and a clear sense of achievement.</P>
<P>Producing a high-quality product at a profit depends on the consistent operation of all systems within the company. SOPs describe the basic systems shared by all company employees. Company success depends on how well these systems work together to produce large volumes of high-quality product that is safe and effective for patients and consumers. </P>
<P>Good procedures and work instructions provide a way to communicate and apply consistent standards and practices within your organization.</P>
<P>GOOD procedures . . .</P>
<P>•    save time and mistakes<BR> •    reduce training costs<BR> •    ensure consistent results<BR> •    empower the workforce<BR> •    get read and used<BR> •    support quality goals<BR> •    enable you to delegate work</P>
<P>But, BAD procedures, can be as disastrous as no procedures at all!</P>
<P>Bad procedures . . .</P>
<P>•    cause errors and frustration<BR> •    increase training costs<BR> •    waste time and money<BR> •    detract from quality goals<BR> •    don’t get read or used<BR> •    Finally, for the above reasons, ALL regulatory agencies expect that a company shall have written procedures and such procedures will be followed. Just like “they” told you</P>
<H3>Areas Covered</H3>
<P>At The End Of The Seminar Attendees Will Have Learned: <BR> •       Why would I want SOPs?<BR> •       What will they do for me?<BR> •       How SOPs fit in with laws and regulations<BR> •       How to organize the SOP writing effort<BR> •       Steps to developing an SOP<BR> •       Presenting the SOP<BR> •       Educate employees about the new SOP<BR> •       Control procedural shift<BR> •       Set up an evaluation and review method for continuous SOP improvement </P>
<H3>Who will Benefit</H3>
<P>This hands-on seminar will help you with creating and following effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to streamline your business and achieve compliance.  This seminar will show you how to describe all the tasks that are essential for your business success, how to do these tasks, and who is responsible for the tasks listed.</P>
<P>Specific benefits include:</P>
<P><STRONG>Reduced learning curve/training time for new employees</STRONG></P>
<P>When someone is new on the job, your well-written and researched SOP can be a lifeline to them to be able to know how things work.  For instance, you can ask your new employee to make all the arrangements for you to organize and attend a workshop in another city.  By referring to the SOP, your new employee will know exactly which travel agency you use with their contact details, which type of car to hire/service to use, how many quotes to get regarding the venue, how to communicate with the workshop delegates, etc. without having to ask you about it all.  It’s a great time-saver and confidence booster for the new employee.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ensured business continuity</STRONG></P>
<P>When a key staff member is on leave or not in the office for some reason, work does not have to stand still.  By referring to the SOP someone else can take over the urgent tasks and do them correctly the first time.</P>
<P><STRONG>Standardized processes</STRONG></P>
<P>The SOP makes it easy to find out what policies and procedures are in place to handle repetitive situations/tasks.</P>
<P><STRONG>Delegating tasks becomes a no-brainer</STRONG></P>
<P>A good SOP will include the organogram of the business, as well as have a short job description and contact details for each staff member. If you need to delegate a certain task, you can see at a glance who will be able to help you or advise you.  You can stop micromanaging, as it is clear who is responsible for what.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ensure that your clients are getting the best possible experience with you</STRONG></P>
<P>Because there is a standard way of dealing with client queries, refunds, promotions, follow-up etc., you can make sure that each client is treated fairly and equally, enhancing their interactions with you.  You thus provide the best possible client service.</P>
<P>A SOP is a living document, which is subject to change.  (It is good to review it quarterly). It is therefore useful to have it in electronic format on a web-based collaborative system so that all employees have access to the latest version.</P>
<P>Do you need to put together a clear and straightforward SOP, compiled in simple language to convey practical information.  Your business will thank you for it!</P>

Even when you know exactly what you’re looking for, job boards can be overwhelming and recruiting events even worse. Not to mention, most of us are forced to look for jobs when we still have a job; minimizing the time we have to apply to different positions and prepare for various types of interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; color: #000000;">Come join GIT SF Managing Director, Lauren Feldman, in a workshop on How to Search for, Apply to and Negotiate your next job. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"> </P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; color: #000000;"><STRONG>Part 1: Search!</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; color: #000000;">Choosing or changing a career path can be a bewildering and anxiety-riddled roller coaster. It's easy to fall into the trap of applying to the wrong jobs, taking an offer to impress someone or just staying where you are out of fear and uncertainty. Recruiters are helpful if you know what you're looking for, but they are seeking the right candidate, they're not helping you search for the right job. A subtle but distinct difference. At this event, you'll be given tools and strategies for deciding what kind of job and what kind of company are right for you. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; color: #000000;"><STRONG>Part 2: Apply!</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; color: #000000;">Lauren will share strategies for organizing your applications, reaching out to the right people and nailing the interviews. Get ready to get your hands dirty with resume optimizations, tricks for a stand-out cover letter and ways to navigate any interview, from first round screening to final round presentations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: medium; color: #000000;"><STRONG>Part 3: Negotiate!</STRONG></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN STYLE="color: #000000;">Walk away with key strategies on how to negotiate your next offer - hint: there's more to compensation than your salary. Whether you're applying to an early stage startup or large public company, you'll leave this bootamp with the tools to get what you're worth (and probably more). </SPAN></P>

These devices are expected to generate billions of petabytes of data traffic between cloud and edge devices. In 2017 alone, there were as many as 8.4B connected devices, highlighting the need to preprocess data at the edge. This has led many IoT device manufacturers, especially those working on vision-based devices like smart cameras, drones, robots, and AR/VR, to bring intelligence to the edge.</p> <p>Through the recent addition of the Movidius VPU technology to its existing AI edge solutions portfolio, Intel is well positioned to provide solutions to help developers and data scientists pioneer the low-power intelligent edge devices segment. Ashwin Vijayakumar gives you an overview of Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, a miniature deep learning hardware development platform that you can use to prototype, tune, and validate your AI programs (specifically deep neural networks).</p> <p>Topics covered in this session:<br/>1. How Movidius VPUs are pioneering DNN-accelerated vision processing<br/>2. Introduction to developer tools for Intel Movidius technology<br/>3. Live demo of deploying image classifiers on NCS<br/>4. Live demo of deploying object detectors on NCS<br/>5. How to run pre-trained and fine-tuned Caffe models on NCS<br/>6. How to run pre-trained and fine-tuned TensorFlow models on NCS<br/>7. Live demo of a smart security camera built using a Raspberry Pi Zero and NCS</p> <p>Preparation for the session (optional): If you already have an Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick, and would like to replicate the live demos during the session, please install the Neural Compute SDK and download the sample repository. Instructions are available at <a href="https://developer.movidius.com/start" class="linkified">https://developer.movidius.com/start</a>.</p> <p>If you would like to replicate the Raspberry Pi Zero based smart security camera PoC, which I will demo during the session, visit these links:<br/>• Practical applications of deep learning at the edge<br/>• Source code and instructions to run the demo - <a href="https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo/tree/master/apps/security-cam" class="linkified">https://github.com/movidius/ncappzoo/tree/master/apps/security-cam</a></p> <p>Speaker Bio: Entrepreneur, intrapreneur, maker, tinkerer, engineer! It's been fun wearing so many hats, but my best experiences have been 'enabling' people to bring their ideas to life by creating powerful prototyping platforms that are easy to use. Having spent a decade enabling startups and customers of fortune 500 companies across automotive, smart phones, robotics and IoT, I believe that given the right developer tools, everybody can develop innovative products.</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Project-AI/events/251141630/ target=blank>Leveraging NLP to Solve Project Management Challenges</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-07-24T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <p>Note the New Location for BNY Mellon Innovation Center!

<P>The Internet has drastically transformed our lives—it permeates every corner of our society and is only growing more influential. The pervasive exposure of our personal information has made us more vulnerable than ever. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff argues that nothing undermines our freedom more than losing control of information about ourselves. He believes our laws must also join the Information Age, and that technology can be used as the ultimate protection of our freedoms.</P>
<P>From 2005 to 2009, Chertoff served as the second U.S. secretary of homeland security, leading efforts to stop terrorism inside American borders. Now, he has shifted his security focus to the cyber front. Chertoff argues that it’s not just a simple loss of privacy that is at stake but our ability to make personal choices without fear of coercion.</P>

To help us get some of the deep learning basics down (and much more), we're very happy to invite Oswald Campesato as our speaker for the month of July!</p> <p>About the talk :</p> <p>A fast-paced introduction to Deep Learning concepts, such as activation functions, cost functions, back propagation, and then a quick dive into CNNs. Basic knowledge of vectors, matrices, and derivatives is helpful in order to derive the maximum benefit from this session.</p> <p>Next we'll see a simple neural network using Keras, followed by an introduction to TensorFlow and TensorBoard. (Bonus points if you know Zorn's Lemma, the Well-Ordering Theorem, and the Axiom of Choice.)</p> <p>Skill level: Beginner-friendly</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Oswald is a former PhD Candidate (ABD) in Mathematics, an education junkie (6 degrees), and an author of 19 technical books. He has worked for Oracle, AAA, and Just Systems of Japan, along with various startups. He has lived/worked in 5 countries on three continents, and in a previous career he worked in South America, Italy, and the French Riviera, and has traveled to over 70 countries on six continents. He has worked from C/C++/Java developer to CTO, comfortable in 4 languages, and dreams of becoming fluent in Japanese. Currently he is working in an AI start-up, and is an instructor at UCSC for a Deep Learning (100% TensorFlow) course, and conducts training in Deep Learning and Android.</p> <p>Twitter: @ocampesato</p> </div><br><br><h2>July 27, 2018</h2><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/murder-at-the-conservatory-tickets-43494109051?aff=ebapi target=blank>Murder at the Conservatory!</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-07-27T19:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P>Join us at the turn of the 20th century for the second season of  <STRONG>Murder at the Conservatory.</STRONG> Don your sleuthing cap and help Detective Burdock Loames crack the caper in...</P>

This newly-labeled data is used to continuously train and deploy new models.</p> <p>We will use PipelineAI and Istio with Kubernetes to quickly - and safely - deploy the new models to a live production environment.</p> <p>Similar to canary deployments of classic microservices, the new models are exposed to only a small amount of production traffic. Slowly, we will shift more traffic to the new models.</p> <p>Using reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits, and metrics from Prometheus/Grafana, live traffic is automatically routed to the winning models based on a given reward function such as MAXIMIZE(number of signups) or MINIMIZE(cost per prediction).</p> <p>All demos run on a hybrid-cloud, open source, GPU-based, Kubernetes cluster optimized for the machine learning and artificial intelligence use cases that we commonly see at PipelineAI.</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Chris Fregly is Founder and Applied AI Engineer at PipelineAI, a Real-Time Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Startup based in San Francisco.</p> <p>He is also an Apache Spark Contributor, a Netflix Open Source Committer, founder of the Global Advanced Spark and TensorFlow Meetup, author of the O’Reilly Training and Video Series titled, "High Performance TensorFlow in Production with Kubernetes and GPUs."</p> <p>Previously, Chris was a Distributed Systems Engineer at Netflix, a Data Solutions Engineer at Databricks, and a Founding Member and Principal Engineer at the IBM Spark Technology Center in San Francisco.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <p>Decent grasp of Computer Science.</p> <p>A good night's sleep!</p> <p>More Info</p> <p>Web: <a href="http://pipeline.ai/workshops" class="linkified">http://pipeline.ai/workshops</a></p> <p>Email: [masked]</p> <p>**Everybody gets their own cloud-based TPU / GPU for the day!!</p> <p>MUST RSVP HERE: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-continuously-train-deploy-tensorflow-serverless-models-in-production-with-kafka-openfaas-tickets-42773050345" class="linkified">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-continuously-train-deploy-tensorflow-serverless-models-in-production-with-kafka-openfaas-tickets-42773050345</a></p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/information-technology-infrastructure-libraryitil-live-weekend-online-training-for-scottsdaleaz-tickets-46398645598?aff=ebapi target=blank>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE LIBRARY(ITIL) Live weekend online Training for scottsdale,AZ-July 28-29,2018</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-07-28T09:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P><SPAN>ITIL traces its roots back to the 1980s as data centers began decentralizing and adopting more distributed or geographically diverse architectures.

<P>In June 2016, an early group of builders, archivists, policymakers, and journalists gathered for the first <A HREF="https://2016.decentralizedweb.net/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow"><STRONG>Decentralized Web Summit</STRONG> </A>within the columns of the Internet Archive headquarters in San Francisco, home to one of the world’s largest digital libraries. Its founder, <STRONG>Brewster Kahle</STRONG>, issued a challenge to these early developers: let’s use decentralized technologies to <A HREF="https://blog.archive.org/2015/02/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">“Lock the Web Open,” </A>this time for good.</P>
<P><SPAN>2016’s gathering was a call to the Dreamers to build a better Web. </SPAN></P>
<P>2018’s <A HREF="https://decentralizedweb.net/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow"><STRONG>Decentralized Web Summit – Global Visions / Working Code</STRONG> </A>is a demonstration of how far we have come. With scores of prototypes and apps now built with decentralized protocols, it’s time to collaborate, communicate and engage the communities who need these tools the most.</P>
<H2><SPAN>The Challenge &amp; Opportunity</SPAN></H2>
<P><SPAN>Today, the Web we use is not private, secure, reliable or free from censorship. It lacks a memory, a way to preserve our digital record through time. By distributing data, processing and hosting across millions of computers worldwide with no centralized control, a new Decentralized Web has the potential to be open, empowering users around the globe to better control and protect their own personal data.</SPAN></P>
<H2>Building Momentum</H2>
<P>We're seeing the Decentralized Web expanding every day. How can we harness that momentum to scale? What code is working and what’s still missing? Can we work together to identify and tackle the roadblock issues? Organized by the <STRONG><A HREF="https://archive.org/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">Internet Archive</A></STRONG><STRONG>,</STRONG> this two-day Summit seeks to align the values of the Open Web with principles of decentralization. To encourage code that supports privacy, security, self-sovereign data and digital memory.</P>
<H2><SPAN>Who Should Attend?</SPAN></H2>
<P><SPAN>Building a Decentralized Web will take Web architects, engineers, activists, artists, archivists and stakeholders from around the world. Together, we can create infrastructure and tools we can trust.  At the Decentralized Web Summit, we invite diverse communities to learn from each other, identify use cases, and build a common understanding of what we mean by the “Decentralized Web.”</SPAN></P>
<H2><SPAN>What Can I Expect?</SPAN></H2>
<P>We'll kick off on T<STRONG>uesday night, July 31st  at 6 PM </STRONG><SPAN>with an</SPAN><STRONG> Opening Party</STRONG><SPAN> at the I<STRONG>nternet Archive</STRONG> in San Francisco. Meet the top builders of decentralized tech from around the world at our </SPAN><STRONG>Science Fair,</STRONG><SPAN> where you can experience deep conversations and demonstrations with leaders of dozens of decentralized projects.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>Then <STRONG>Wednesday-Thursday, August 1-2nd, 8 AM -6 PM</STRONG> we move to the historic <STRONG>San Francisco Mint</STRONG>, for a multi-track Summit with hands-on workshops, technical integrations, events exploring the law, policy and governance models that may impact the space, along with both humanitarian and artistic use cases for a new set of tools.</SPAN></P>
<P>Still wanting more?  On <STRONG>Friday, August 3 at 10 AM-5 PM</STRONG>, we'll open the doors of the Internet Archive where we invite you to join us for lunch and a tour.  We'll have tables set up for informal collaborating, hacking, and just hanging out.</P>

Codd's relational algebra, and on production experience using SQL and dplyr at big data scale. rquery is powerful, easy to teach, has error checking, and basic query optimization. It is the fastest way to manipulate remote big data from R, for example data found on PostgreSQL or Spark. rqdatatable is a new package that implements the rquery grammar in memory using the data.table package. This allows the same rquery pipeline to be used remotely. such as on Spark, and for in-memory data. rqdatatable transforms are usually nearly as fast as native data.table code and usually much faster than the equivalent base-R or dplyr code.</p> <p>These packages can save substantial development and infrastructure costs.</p> <p>BIO</p> <p>John Mount is a principal consultant at Win-Vector LLC. He is a frequent writer, speaker, and R package contributor. He is one of the authors of the popular book "Practical Data Science with R" (Zumel, Mount; Manning 2014). John has a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.</p> <p>Win-Vector LLC is a San Francisco based data science consulting company. Win-Vector LLC supports the important R packages vtreat, wrapr, rquery, and many more. It also hosts the popular Win-Vector blog, a technical resource used by many data scientists. Win-Vector LLC supplies consulting and training especially for projects involving R, statistics, machine learning, big data, or Spark. Past clients include Deliotte, EMC, Intuit, Genentech, Microsoft, SalesForce, and Zions Bank. Win-Vector LLC can be reached by writing to John Mount at [masked] .

High-end apparel, accessories, and luxury goods toe a careful line: On one hand, underground resale markets for their products make them clear targets for online fraud. On the other hand, turning away customers willing to pay for high-end products means huge sums of money left on the table - especially when those customers belong to emerging segments, for instance from the rising middle class in developing markets.</p> <p>Historically, high-end fashion retailers have leaned away from risk, declining a large number of customers suspected of being fraudulent. But unprecedented breadth and depth of data on risk and fraud behavior is making it possible to accept payments without fear, changing the way siloed merchants have run their businesses.</p> <p>7:30 Cognitive Search: Understanding user intentions to build interactive search and discovery experiences<br/>Ciro Greco, Founder and CEO at TOOSO <a href="https://Tooso.ai/" class="linkified">https://Tooso.ai/</a></p> <p>8:00-8:15 Closing remarks</p> </div><br><br><h3 class="title"><a href=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/kintones-social-impact-challenge-tickets-45122423383?aff=ebapi target=blank>Kintone's Social Impact Challenge</a></h2><br><div class="date_time"><strong>Date: </strong> 2018-08-09T18:00:00</div><br><div class="desc"><strong>Description:</strong> <P>Are you passionate about making the world a better place and using technology to make it happen?

<P><STRONG>What:</STRONG></P>
<P>The Kintone Impact Challenge is a collaborative, crowdfunded event supporting social entrepreneurs who are using tech to respond to emerging problems in their communities.</P>
<P><SPAN>Kintone will invite social impact-driven teams to apply to be one of three finalists to pitch their idea in a live event at WeWork in San Francisco on August 9th to walk home with crowdfunded prizes.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P><STRONG>How:</STRONG></P>
<P>Each ticket to the event ($30) counts as one vote and goes directly toward the organization of your choice. After the presentations, each vote will help us determine our first, second and third place winners. </P>
<P>Kintone will award the first place winner $5,000, followed by $2,500 and $1,000 for second and third place winners. Prizes also include a one year membership to Social Enterprise Alliance and Kintone licenses to manage your impact-driven data and workflows.<BR><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Why:</STRONG></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN>To help social entrepreneurs build impact-driven companies full of happy teams championing change and to</SPAN></SPAN> make the world a more equitable playing field, we need to not only invent new models but also improve the structures that exist, regardless if it’s a local government, school or Fortune 500 company.<BR><BR></P>

How do you use it? A Geo PDF map is a map you download and store on your smart phone. Use the free app called PDFMaps to view and navigate from the stored map in your phone. Use it on hikes or bike rides to log your distance, start time, duration, and more.</P>
<P>You don’t need wi-fi or a data connection once the app is installed. It uses your phone’s GPS feature so it works even if you are out of range of mobile phone service. Meet at the Visitor Center to see a slideshow and find out how to obtain a copy of a Geo PDF map of the Don Edwards SF Bay National Wildlife Refuge. A live demonstration will follow. Led by docent Gregg Aronson.</P>
<P><STRONG>Special Instructions:</STRONG><BR>Please go to your app store and download the FREE Avenza app prior to coming to the program. There is no wi-fi at the refuge.  Then, download these maps onto your phone. </P>

<P>All facilities manufacturing pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, cosmetics, and personal care products are likely to have high purity water systems. In spite of this purity, microorganisms can flourish within these systems and lead to undesirable contamination of facility processes and their products. Of all the individuals at the facility, it is site’s microbiologists who should understand the microorganisms in water systems and how best to monitor and control them. Sadly, this is often not the case due to the lack of familiarity with biofilm and its impact on water system sampling, testing, sanitization, and routine maintenance. This lack of understanding of microbial control often leads to poor system designs, poor system sampling, poor system maintenance and poor sanitization practices, and as a result, ongoing microbial problems with the water.</P>
<P>This course is designed to provide a microbiology-focused education about all aspects of water systems and how biofilm manages to thrive there. Prior microbiological education or training, though a plus, is not a requirement, since this training is for everyone involved with water systems, from the lab to utility room operations. The instructor will provide the necessary background needed to understand this very important subject matter. This understanding is essential for the proper design, validation, operation, monitoring, and maintenance of a high purity water system. Without this understanding, water system control and monitoring consists of a set of rules that often don’t work or result in erroneous monitoring data and can cause everything from very costly and unnecessary system downtime to patient injury and product recalls.</P>
<P> </P>
<H3>Learning Objectives:</H3>
<P>At the completion of the course, attendees will be able to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Understand the role of system design, maintenance and sanitization in controlling microbial levels in pharmaceutical water systems.</LI>
<LI>Successfully troubleshoot problems resulting from poor design/maintenance versus sampling or testing problems.</LI>
<LI>Devise water system validation protocols that truly validate microbial control.</LI>
<LI>Validate their water microbial test method.</LI>
<LI>Develop sound Alert and Action Levels and Water Specifications.</LI>
<LI>Defend their test method, in-process control levels and specifications to FDA.</LI>
</UL>
<P> </P>
<H3>Who Will Benefit:</H3>
<P>This 2-day course is particularly relevant to managers, supervisors, and operatives taking on new responsibilities related to water, but also for experienced water personnel to learn the “true” whys behind what they do and perhaps better ways of doing things. Specific positions that will benefit:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Microbiology Laboratory supervisors and analysts responsible for water sampling and testing</LI>
<LI>Quality Assurance personnel responsible for water system deviation management and change control</LI>
<LI>Regulatory and Compliance professionals responsible for FDA interactions</LI>
<LI>Process and Utility Engineers responsible for water system maintenance, troubleshooting, and excursion mitigation</LI>
<LI>Facility Engineers responsible for water system design or renovation</LI>
<LI>Validation personnel for water system qualification</LI>

<P><BR></P>
<P>All facilities manufacturing pharmaceuticals, biologics, medical devices, cosmetics, and personal care products are likely to have high purity water systems. In spite of this purity, microorganisms can flourish within these systems and lead to undesirable contamination of facility processes and their products. Of all the individuals at the facility, it is site’s microbiologists who should understand the microorganisms in water systems and how best to monitor and control them. Sadly, this is often not the case due to the lack of familiarity with biofilm and its impact on water system sampling, testing, sanitization, and routine maintenance. This lack of understanding of microbial control often leads to poor system designs, poor system sampling, poor system maintenance and poor sanitization practices, and as a result, ongoing microbial problems with the water.</P>
<P>This course is designed to provide a microbiology-focused education about all aspects of water systems and how biofilm manages to thrive there. Prior microbiological education or training, though a plus, is not a requirement, since this training is for everyone involved with water systems, from the lab to utility room operations. The instructor will provide the necessary background needed to understand this very important subject matter. This understanding is essential for the proper design, validation, operation, monitoring, and maintenance of a high purity water system. Without this understanding, water system control and monitoring consists of a set of rules that often don’t work or result in erroneous monitoring data and can cause everything from very costly and unnecessary system downtime to patient injury and product recalls.</P>

<P><SPAN>9:15 - 10:00am: Human (Resources) In the Loop: AI for HR</SPAN>, <EM>presented by Eric Shangle, Director of People Operations, Figure Eight</EM></P>
<P><SPAN>AI helps us organize data for meaningful business decisions, and many don't realize we already use AI in our daily work. Let's demystify AI and highlight areas that are already using AI in HR. However, what will the future be for AI in HR and what are companies working on right now? Attend this session to:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN>1:45 - 2:30pm: </SPAN><SPAN>Cyber Security: What HR Professionals Need to Know</SPAN>, <EM>presented by </EM><EM>Jenny Hayes, MSOD, PHR, Senior HR Operations Manager, Astreya</EM><BR CLASS="kix-line-break">Cyber threats are real, and it's not only the responsibility of IT professionals to safeguard data. HR practitioners need to be aware of potential cyber threats. Business Email Compromise (BEC), in particular, is a threat to HR organizations, as scammers are pretending to be C-suite execs and ask unsuspecting HR team members for confidential employee data. At the end of the day, it's the responsibility of the person responding to the email to be "cyber aware."<BR></P>
<P><SPAN>This session won’t be highly technical, but a practical discussion to cover the recent press regarding phishing and BEC/BES. In 2016, CompTIA revealed that 45% of employees receive no cybersecurity training from their employers. We will address recent reports from the IRS as well as Google regarding phishing scams. </SPAN><BR CLASS="kix-line-break"><BR CLASS="kix-line-break"></P>
<P><SPAN>Technology transforms how HR departments contact employees, store files and analyze employee performance. When used properly, technology makes HR practices more efficient. When used poorly, it can get in the way of HR operations. Good HR practices maximize the benefits and minimize the problems. </SPAN>All areas of HR are going to be touched by technology.<BR></P>
<P><SPAN>HR has typically been a bit behind the times on technology. However, things have changed. IT and HR have merged, as many applications that HR professionals use do not involve IT anymore. Cloud-based apps that can run on any browser and are platform/OS independent means that HR practitioners are on their own. About half of all HR systems today reside in the cloud, meaning that HR has become more influential in how technology decisions are made. HR is more likely to "own" its technology while IT's role is limited to ensuring that it meets requirements in security, systems integration and other technical areas. This new dynamic between the HR and IT departments means relationships can grow tense; IT must adjust to a position in which it wields less clout. </SPAN><BR CLASS="kix-line-break"><BR CLASS="kix-line-break"></P>
<P><SPAN>Having worked with the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) to promote their research on cybersecurity, we found:</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>● </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="Apple-tab-span"></SPAN>63% of employees use their work mobile device for personal activities.<BR CLASS="kix-line-break">● <SPAN CLASS="Apple-tab-span"></SPAN>94% of employees connect their laptop/mobile to public Wi-Fi networks.<BR CLASS="kix-line-break">● <SPAN CLASS="Apple-tab-span"></SPAN>49% of employees have at least 10 logins, but only 34% have at least 10 unique logins.</P>
<P><SPAN>We will discuss 5 key areas of focus and tips to help educate your users to change their common “bad habits.” Attend this session to discover:</SPAN><BR CLASS="kix-line-break">1) Top cyber security threats that plague companies today.<BR CLASS="kix-line-break">2) What is BEC/BES and how does this apply to HR practitioners?<BR CLASS="kix-line-break">3)Training that can be provided to help empower the HR practitioner and end user.</P>
